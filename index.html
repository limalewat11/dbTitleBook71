Now, for the first time, their story is revealed.<br> <br>A captivating story of contest, failure, and success, <i>The Age of Atheists </i>sweeps up William James and the pragmatists; Sigmund Freud and psychoanalysis; Pablo Picasso, James Joyce, and Albert Camus; the poets of World War One and the novelists of World War Two; scientists, from Albert Einstein to Stephen Hawking; and the rise of the new Atheists&#x2014;Dawkins, Harris, and Hitchens. This is a story of courage, of the thousands of individuals who, sometimes at great risk, devoted tremendous creative energies to devising ways to fill a godless world with self-reliance, invention, hope, wit, and enthusiasm.

Is Nietzsche to Blame?<br> <br>By the summer of 1990 the author Salman Rushdie had been living in hiding for more than a year. This had followed a fatwa, an Islamic juristic ruling, issued by the Iranian supreme cleric, Ayatollah Khomeini, on February 14, 1989, in which he had said, &#x201c;I inform the proud Muslim people of the world that the author of the Satanic Verses book, which is against Islam, the Prophet and the Quran, and all those involved in its publication who were aware of its content, are sentenced to death. I ask all Muslims to execute them wherever they find them.&#x201d;<br> <br>This was by any standard a monstrous event, made all the more terrible by Khomeini&#x2019;s claim of authority over all Muslims. But, however wrong, the threat had to be dealt with and Rushdie was given police protection and the use of a bulletproof Jaguar, though he had to find his safe houses himself. In July of that year, the police had suggested a further refinement for his safety&#x2014;a wig. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be able to walk down the street without attracting attention,&#x201d; he was told. The Metropolitan Police&#x2019;s best wig man was sent to see him and took away a sample of his hair. The wig was made and arrived &#x201c;in a brown cardboard box looking like a small sleeping animal.&#x201d; When he put it on, the police said it &#x201c;looked great&#x201d; and they decided to &#x201c;take it for a walk.&#x201d; They drove to Sloane Street in London&#x2019;s Knightsbridge and parked near the fashionable department store Harvey Nichols. When he got out of the Jaguar &#x201c;every head turned to stare at him and several people burst into wide grins or even laughter. &#x2018;Look,&#x2019; he heard a man&#x2019;s voice say, &#x2018;there&#x2019;s that bastard Rushdie in a wig.&#x2019;&#x201d;1<br> <br>It is a funny story, despite the grim circumstances in which it took place, and Rushdie tells it again himself in his memoir, Joseph Anton (the cover name he adopted), which he felt safe to publish only in 2012, nearly a quarter of a century after the original fatwa.<br> <br>There was certainly something missing in his life during those anxious times, the most precious thing of all&#x2014;his liberty. But that is not exactly what the German philosopher J�rgen Habermas had in mind when he wrote his celebrated essay, &#x201c;An Awareness of What Is Missing: Faith and Reason in a Post-secular Age&#x201d; (2008). He, too, was concerned with the impact of religion on our lives but meant something no less precious perhaps, and far more difficult to pin down.<br> <br>NO &#x201c;AMEN&#x201d;: THE TERMS OF OUR EXISTENCE AND THE IDEA OF A MORAL WHOLE<br> <br>This something had first occurred to him after he attended a memorial service for Max Frisch, the Swiss author and playwright, held in St. Peter&#x2019;s Church in Zurich on April 9, 1991. The service began with Karin Pilliod, Frisch&#x2019;s partner, reading out a brief declaration written by the deceased. It said, among other things: &#x201c;We let our nearest speak, and without an &#x2018;amen.&#x2019; I am grateful to the ministers of St. Peter&#x2019;s in Zurich&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for their permission to place the coffin in the church during our memorial service. The ashes will be strewn somewhere.&#x201d; Two friends spoke, but there was no priest and no blessing. The mourners were mostly people who had little time for church and religion. Frisch himself had drawn up the menu for the meal that followed.<br> <br>Habermas wrote much later (in 2008) that at the time the ceremony did not strike him as peculiar, but that, as the years passed, he came to the view that the form, place and progression of the service were odd. &#x201c;Clearly, Max Frisch, an agnostic, who rejected any profession of faith, had sensed the awkwardness of non-religious burial practices and, by his choice of place, publicly declared that the enlightened modern age has failed to find a suitable replacement for a religious way of coping with the final rite de passage which brings life to a close.&#x201d;<br> <br>And this more than a hundred years since Nietzsche announced the death of God.<br> <br>Habermas used this event&#x2014;Frisch&#x2019;s memorial&#x2014;as the basis for &#x201c;An Awareness of What Is Missing.&#x201d; In that essay he traces the development of thought from the Axial Age to the Modern period and argues that, while &#x201c;the cleavage between secular knowledge and revealed knowledge cannot be bridged,&#x201d; the fact that religious traditions are, or were in 2008, an &#x201c;unexhausted force,&#x201d; must mean that they are based more on reason than secular critics allow, and this &#x201c;reason,&#x201d; he thinks, lies in the religious appeal to what he calls &#x201c;solidarity,&#x201d; the idea of a &#x201c;moral whole,&#x201d; a world of collectively binding ideals, &#x201c;the idea of the Kingdom of God on earth.&#x201d; It is this, he says, that contrasts successfully with secular reason, and provides the &#x201c;awkward&#x201d; awareness of something that is missing. In effect, he says that the main monotheisms had taken several ideas from classical Greece&#x2014;Athens as much as Jerusalem&#x2014;and based their appeal on Greek reason as much as on faith: this is one reason why they have endured.<br> <br>Habermas has one of the most fertile, idiosyncratic and provocative minds of the post&#x2013;Second World War conversation, and his ideas on this score are underlined by the similar notions of his American contemporaries Thomas Nagel and Ronald Dworkin. In his recent book, Secular Philosophy and the Religious Temperament, Nagel puts it this way: &#x201c;Existence is something tremendous, and day-to-day life, however indispensable, seems an insufficient response to it, a failure of consciousness. Outrageous as it sounds, the religious temperament regards a merely human life as insufficient, as a partial blindness to or rejection of the terms of our exis�tence. It asks for something more encompassing without knowing what it might be.&#x201d;<br> <br>The most important question for many people, Nagel says, is this: &#x201c;How can one bring into one&#x2019;s individual life a full recognition of one&#x2019;s relation to the universe as a whole?&#x201d; [Italics added.] Among atheists, he says, physical science is the primary means whereby we understand the universe as a whole, &#x201c;but it will seem unintelligible [as a means] to make sense of human existence altogether.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We recognize that we are products of the world and its history, generated and sustained in existence in ways we hardly understand, so that in a sense every individual life represents far more than itself.&#x201d; At the same time he agrees with the British philosopher Bernard Williams that the &#x201c;transcendent impulse,&#x201d; which has been with us since at least Plato, &#x201c;must be resisted,&#x201d; and that the real object of philosophical reflection must be the ever more accurate description of the world &#x201c;independent of perspective.&#x201d; He goes on: &#x201c;The marks of philosophy are reflection and heightened self-awareness, not maximal transcendence of the human perspective.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There is no cosmic point of view, and therefore no test of cosmic significance that we can either pass or fail.&#x201d;2<br> <br>In a later book, Mind and Cosmos (2012), he goes further, arguing that the neo-Darwinian account of the evolution of nature, life, consciousness, reason and moral values&#x2014;the current scientific orthodoxy&#x2014;&#x201c;is almost certainly false.&#x201d; As an atheist, he nonetheless felt that both materialism and theism are inadequate as &#x201c;transcendent conceptions,&#x201d; but at the same time acknowledged that it is impossible for us to abandon the search &#x201c;for a transcendent view of our place in the universe.&#x201d; And he therefore entertained the possibility (on virtually no evidence, as he conceded) that &#x201c;life is not just a physical phenomenon&#x201d; but includes &#x201c;teleological elements.&#x201d; According to the hypothesis of natural teleology, he wrote, there would be &#x201c;a cosmic predisposition to the formation of life, consciousness, and the value that is inseparable from them.&#x201d; He admitted: &#x201c;In the present intellectual climate such a possibility is unlikely to be taken seriously&#x201d;; and indeed, he has been much criticized for this argument.<br> <br>The argument itself will be discussed more fully in chapter 26, but it fits in here because it shows that, 130-odd years after Nietzsche famously announced &#x201c;the death of God,&#x201d; many people (though by no means all) are still trying to find other ways to look out upon our world than the traditional religious viewpoints.<br> <br>Almost simultaneously, Nagel was joined by his fellow American philosopher colleague Ronald Dworkin in his Religion Without God (2013). Here, too, the main thrust of the argument will be discussed in chapter 26, but Dworkin&#x2019;s chief point was that &#x201c;religious atheism&#x201d; is not an oxymoron (not anymore, anyway); that religion, for him and others like him, &#x201c;does not necessarily mean a belief in God&#x201d;&#x2014;rather, &#x201c;it concerns the meaning of human life and what living well means&#x201d;; and life&#x2019;s intrinsic meaning and nature&#x2019;s intrinsic beauty are the central ingredients of the fully religious attitude to life. These convictions cannot be isolated from the rest of one&#x2019;s life&#x2014;they permeate existence, generate pride, remorse and thrill, mystery being an important part of that thrill. And he said that many scientists, when they confront the unimaginable vastness of space and the astounding complexity of atomic particles, have an emotional reaction that many describe in almost traditional religious terms&#x2014;as &#x201c;numinous,&#x201d; for example.<br> <br>This feels new, though, as we shall see in chapter 15, some of it at least was presaged by John Dewey between the two world wars and hinted at by Michael Polanyi in the late 1950s and early 1960s.3 The significant factor, for now, is that these three philosophers&#x2014;on either side of the Atlantic and each at the very peak of his profession&#x2014;are all saying much the same thing, if in different ways. They share the view that, five hundred and more years after science began to chip away at many of the foundations of Christianity and the other major faiths, there is still an awkwardness, as Habermas put it, or a blindness or &#x201c;unsufficiency&#x201d; (Nagel); a mystery, thrilling and numinous, as Dworkin characterized it, in regard to the relationship between religion and the secular world. All three agree with Bernard Williams that the &#x201c;transcendent&#x201d; impulse must be resisted, but they acknowledge&#x2014;ironically&#x2014;that we cannot escape the search for transcendence and that, as a result, many people feel &#x201c;something&#x201d; is missing. This is, in effect, they say, the modern secular predicament.<br> <br>It is in many ways extraordinary that these three individuals&#x2014;all hugely respected&#x2014;should, within a few months of each other, but independently, come to similar conclusions: that, depending on where you start counting&#x2014;from the time of Galileo and Copernicus, four or five hundred years ago, or Nietzsche, 130 years ago, secularization is still not fitting the bill, is still seriously lacking in&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. something.<br> <br>The Canadian philosopher Charles Taylor has no doubt what that something is. In two very long books, Sources of the Self (1989) and A Secular Age (2007), he repeatedly charges that people today who inhabit a secular world and lack faith are missing out, missing out on something important, vital&#x2014;perhaps the most important something there is&#x2014;namely, as he puts it, a sense of wholeness, fulfillment, fullness of meaning, a sense of something higher; they have an incompleteness, that there is in the modern world &#x201c;a massive blindness&#x201d; to the fact that there is &#x201c;some purpose in life beyond the utilitarian.&#x201d;4<br> <br>Human flourishing, Taylor maintains&#x2014;a fulfilled life&#x2014;can be achieved only via religion (Christianity, in his case). Otherwise, the world is &#x201c;disenchanted,&#x201d; life is a &#x201c;subtraction story&#x201d; with important parts missing. With no sense of &#x201c;transcendence,&#x201d; no sense of the &#x201c;cosmic sacred,&#x201d; we are left with &#x201c;merely human values,&#x201d; which he finds &#x201c;woefully inadequate.&#x201d; The &#x201c;higher times,&#x201d; he says, have faded, we are imbued with &#x201c;a sense of malaise, emptiness, a need for meaning&#x201d;; there is a terrible sense of flatness in the everyday, the emptiness of the ordinary, and this need for meaning can be met only &#x201c;by a recovery of transcendence.&#x201d;5<br> <br>POROUS VERSUS BUFFERED SELVES<br> <br>Taylor pursues this argument further than any of the others. He says that humanism has failed, that the &#x201c;pursuit of happiness,&#x201d; a current concern, is a much thinner idea or ideal than &#x201c;fulfillment&#x201d; or &#x201c;flourishing&#x201d; or transcendence; that it uses a &#x201c;less subtle language,&#x201d; giving rise to less subtle experiences; that it is lacking in &#x201c;spiritual insight,&#x201d; spontaneity or immediacy, is devoid of &#x201c;harmony&#x201d; and &#x201c;balance,&#x201d; and is ultimately unhealthy.<br> <br>The modern individual, he says, is a &#x201c;buffered&#x201d; self rather than a &#x201c;porous&#x201d; self. A porous self is open to all the feelings and experiences of the world &#x201c;out there,&#x201d; while the modern buffered self is denied these experiences because our scientific education teaches us only concepts, our experiences are intellectual, emotional, sexual and so on, rather than &#x201c;whole.&#x201d; Modern individuals have been denied a &#x201c;master narrative&#x201d; in which they may find their place, and without which their &#x201c;sense of loss can perhaps never be stilled.&#x201d; Without these factors, he goes on, there is no scope for any human life to achieve a &#x201c;sense of greatness&#x201d; out of which a &#x201c;higher&#x201d; view of fulfillment arises. The sense that there is &#x201c;something more&#x201d; presses in on us, and, therefore, we can never be &#x201c;comfortable&#x201d; with unbelief.<br> <br>Phew. Skeptics may raise their eyebrows at these claims but there is no doubt that they chime with what many people feel or think. And the likes of Taylor find support for their arguments in the statistical fact that, after the high point of secularization in the 1960s and 1970s, at the beginning of the twenty-first century more and more people are turning&#x2014;or returning&#x2014;to religion. Richard Kearney has even given it a name, Anatheism.6 We shall return to the (ambiguous) meaning of these statistics presently, but it is certainly true that in 2014 the battle between religious thinkers and atheists is as fierce (and indeed as bitter) as it has been for many a year.<br> <br>For their part, the militant atheists, as they have been described, largely occupy a Darwinian position. Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, Sam Harris and Christopher Hitchens, to name only the best known, follow Charles Darwin in seeing human beings as an entirely naturally occurring biological species, which has slowly evolved from &#x201c;lower&#x201d; animals, in a universe that has likewise evolved over the past 13.5 billion years from a &#x201c;singularity,&#x201d; or &#x201c;Big Bang,&#x201d; itself a naturally occurring process (albeit where the laws of nature break down) that we shall understand someday. This process has no need of any supernatural entity.<br> <br>In the latest rounds of this debate, Dawkins and Harris have used Darwinian science to explain the moral landscape in which we live, and Hitchens has described such institutions as the library, or &#x201c;lunch with a friend,&#x201d; as episodes in a modern life just as fulfilling as prayer or church- or synagogue- or mosque-going.<br> <br>The average reader&#x2014;especially the average young reader&#x2014;could be forgiven for thinking that this is all there is to the debate: either we embrace religion, or we embrace Darwinism and its implications. Steve Stewart-Williams has taken this reasoning to its logical conclusion when he says, in Darwin, God and the Meaning of Life (2010), that there is no God, that the universe is entirely natural and in that sense accidental, so that there can be no purpose to life, and no ultimate meaning other than that which we work out for ourselves as individuals.<br> <br>But though it is the Darwinists who, among athe...</p><h2>Princess Academy 1ST Edition Us</h2><p>From the author of The Goose Girl comes this fabulous tale of a group of mountain girls who find themselves in training as possible royal brides.

The poem is a lullaby concerning the moon man who flings his silver net over the sea, fishing for a variety of things. It has charming imagery and a contagious rhythm but Conover's illustrations become almost feverish at times. Placing the verses in a world of anthropomorphic cats, she depicts a young male journeying to imaginary places containing a living zodiac, an undersea palace, and dancing sharks. The symbols are so varied and based so fleetingly upon the original poem that the artist has added a two-page spread at the book's end explaining her busy renditions. The colors have been overapplied to such a saturation that the deep blues, greens, and violets flatten the excruciating details, and the characterization of the animals, sealife, and an occasional human jump uncomfortably between caricature and photorealism. Adults wallowing in some fantasy world may find these paintings interesting but as illustrations, they lack a defined focus and seem fairly presumptive. However charming this 67-year-old poem may be, Conover's interpretation further restricts its already limited appeal to children. --Denise Anton Wright, Library Book Selection Service, Inc., Bloomington, IL<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Sex God: Exploring the Endless Connections between Sexuality and Spirituality</h2><p>Introduction: This is Really about That Chapter One: God Wears Lipstick Chapter Two: Sexy on the Inside Chapter Three: Angels and Animals Chapter Four: Leather, Whips, and Fruit Chapter Five: She Ran into the Girls&#39; Bathroom Chapter Six: Worth Dying For Chapter Seven: Under the Chuppah Chapter Eight: Johnny and June Chapter Nine: Whoopee Forever Epilogue: More Balloons, Please Endnotes/Resources/Discussion</p><p>Rob Bell lives with his family in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where he&#39;s the founding pastor of Mars Hill Bible Church.

"Is sex a picture of heaven?" he wonders. It's all about God and sex and heaven, he says: "...they're connected. And they can't be separated. Where the one is you will always find the other." Bell's book isn't a sex manual, an exploration of the differences between men and women or a marriage how-to, though all of that is here. Instead, it's the story of God becoming human, of humans mirroring God and love made manifest in the chaos of our humanity. <i>Sex God</i> is about relationships revealed in a way that elevates the human condition and offers hope to those whose relationships are wounded. In Bell's spare, somewhat oblique style, he addresses lust, respect, denial, risk, acceptance and more. His love for God and the Bible is clear, as is his ability to ask probing questions and offer answers that make readers think deeply about their own lives. He does a fine job using the Bible and real life to show that our physical relationships are really about spiritual relationships. This book joyfully ties, and then tightens, the knot between God and humankind. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He is senior contributing writer at Sports Illustrated, where his byline first appeared in 1962. A weekly commentator for NPR&#39;s Morning Edition, he is also a regular correspondent on the HBO show Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel. As a journalist, Deford was most recently presented with the National Magazine Award for profiles, and has been elected to the Hall of Fame of the National Association of Sportscasters and Sportswriters. Voted by his peers as U.S. Sportswriter of the Year six times, he was also cited by The American Journalism Review as the nation&#39;s finest sportswriter and was twice voted Magazine Writer of the Year by the Washington Journalism Review. He has been presented with a Christopher Award and awards for distinguished service to journalism from the University of Missouri and Northeastern University. For his radio and TV work, Deford has won both an Emmy and a George Foster Peabody Award.*Starred Review* When John McGraw stepped down in 1933 after 31 years as manager of the New York Giants, the team had won 10 National League pennants and three World Series trophies--and baseball had become the national pastime. McGraw--known somewhat redundantly as "Little Napoleon"--was the most well-known personality in the game during his early years at the Giants' helm, but his celebrity was soon outstripped by his star player, the game's first "hero," pitcher Christy Mathewson, who won 30 or more games in each of McGraw's first three full seasons as his manager. Deford, a senior contributing editor at <i>Sports Illustrated </i>and<i> </i>author of 14 books, does much more than make a case for his two subjects' sporting legacy. He portrays their fame and emerging preeminence in America's consciousness as parallel to and emblematic of baseball's explosion in popularity, showing in the process how the growth of sport was made possible in the early years of the twentieth century by the rise of the middle class and the increase in disposable income. With McGraw as the gruff but fair father figure and the college-educated Mathewson as the golden boy whom parents wanted for their daughters, the pair became the first sports figures to intrigue the public as individuals. Deford effectively weaves the threads of these two touchstone lives into the broader tapestry of an ascendant sport and a rapidly modernizing America. A fine baseball book but just as fine a study of American popular culture. <i>Wes Lukowsky</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Carter (David Carter&#39;s Bugs)</h2><p>What could be better than one Bug of Christmas? Twelve of them! Bug fans of all ages will get in the spirit and join in the holiday fun with this pop-up extravaganza!</p><p>David A. Carter has bugs on the brain. Pop-up bugs, to be precise. Popular author of a series of insect-rich books, including <i>Jingle Bugs</i> and <i>Bed Bugs</i>, Carter is a masterful paper engineer. His latest holiday extravaganza takes a traditional Christmas song and turns it positively buggy. On each of the 12 days of Christmas "my true love" gives a new, festive creepy crawler--leaping, lurking, or popping right out of the box. By the fourth day, we're up to "four Snowflake Bugs, three Sneaky Bugs, two Cuckoo Bugs, and a Fruitcake Bug in a pear tree." Now if that's not true love...<p> Young pop-up enthusiasts will revel in the silly six-legged critters Carter creates. Decked out in antlers, tutus, and tinsel, these bugs are definitely set for the season. Unlike the once-opened gifts of Christmas, these pop-up packages bring enjoyment over and over again.

Three introductory chapters cover the basics of avian biology, attracting birds to one's yard, and field observation techniques. Arranged by habitat, brief descriptive accounts (one or two per page) of about 200 common North American species make up the bulk of the work. Also included are a well-chosen bibliography, directories of birding hotlines and organizations, and a combined index/glossary.

The fortunes of one of Bingtown&#39;s oldest families rest on the newly awakened liveship Vivacia. For Althea Vestrit, the ship is her rightful legacy unjustly denied her-a legacy she will risk anything to reclaim. For Althea&#39;s young nephew Wintrow, wrenched from his religious studies and forced to serve aboard ship, Vivacia is a life sentence. But the fate of the Vestrit family-and the ship-may ultimately lie in the hands of an outsider. The ruthless pirate Kennit seeks a way to seize power over all the denizens of the Pirate Isles...and the first step of his plan requires him to capture his own liveship and bend it to his will.</p><p>Robin Hobb, author of the Farseer trilogy, has returned to that world for a new series. <i>Ship of Magic</i> is a sea tale, reminiscent of <i>Moby Dick</i> and Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey/Maturin series in its details of shipboard life. It is also a fantasy adventure with sea serpents, pirates, and all sorts of magic. The <i>liveships</i> have distinct personalities and partner with specific people, somewhat like Anne McCaffrey's Brain ships and their Brawns, though these are trading ships and have full crews.<p> Hobb has peopled the book with many wonderfully developed characters. Most of the primary ones are members of the Vestritts, an Old Trader family which owns the liveship <i>Vivacia</i>. Their stories are intercut with those of Kennit, the ambitious pirate Brashen, the disinherited scion of another family who served on the Vestritt's ship, and <i>Paragon</i>, an old liveship abandoned and believed mad. The sentient sea serpents have their own story hinted at, as well.</p><p> Though <i>Ship of Magic</i> is full of action, none of the plotlines get resolved in this book. Readers who resent being left with many questions and few answers after almost 700 pages should think twice before starting, or wait until the rest of the series is out so that their suspense won't be too prolonged. But Hobb's writing draws you in and makes you care desperately about what will happen next, the mark of a terrific storyteller. <i>--Nona Vero</i></p><b>Praise for the Farseer trilogy by Robin Hobb:</b><p><i>Assassin's Apprentice</i><br>"A richly detailed debut.

A weak man with little control over his own government, the 55-year-old Ferdinand nevertheless had the good sense to realize that his empire needed a younger person at the helm. Without children of his own, he had chosen as his successor his nephew, 18-year-old Franz Josef. For this, his final official appearance, Ferdinand, as was his habit, wore civilian dress; his nephew-a particularly handsome man with a slender figure-donned the tight-fitting white tunic and red trousers of a general officer in the imperial army. Only a small group had been assembled to witness the abdication: ministers of government, several high-ranking army officers, and the members of the Habsburg royal family. Among the latter were Franz Josef's parents: Archduke Franz Karl, the emperor's brother, who, considered as ineffectual as Ferdinand, had stepped aside in favor of his oldest son; and bursting with maternal pride and splendidly turned out in a court dress of white moir� silk with a jeweled rose in her hair, Archduchess Sophie, the guiding force behind her "Franzi's" accession to the throne. In a nervous voice, halting between words and occasionally emphasizing the wrong syllables, Ferdinand read out a prepared statement on behalf of himself and his wife, the empress Maria Anna. "Important reasons," he began, "have led Us to the irrevocable decision to lay down Our Crown in favor of Our beloved nephew, Archduke Franz Josef." After various other official acts were read aloud by Prime Minister Felix zu Schwarzenburg, the new emperor of Austria approached his uncle and knelt before him. Ferdinand stroked the young man's hair and, lifting him to his feet, proclaimed, "God Bless you! Be good and God will protect you. I have done this willingly." </p><p>Franz Josef, who was born on August 18, 1830, had seemed destined for great things from a very early age. His education had been entrusted to two powerful tutors: in the art of statecraft, to Klemens Metternich, the chancellor of the empire; in the matters of philosophy and religion, to the Archbishop of Vienna, Joseph von Rauscher. Between the age of six and his ascendancy to the throne, he was indoctrinated with the political philosophy of the monarch's divine right to rule. He was also taught French, Italian, Hungarian, and Czech in addition to his native German-all the languages that might be of use to a future Habsburg emperor, whose many royal titles included king of Hungary and Bohemia, king of Lombardy and Venetia, grand duke of Tuscany and Krakow, grand duke of Transylvania, and margave of Moravia. </p><p>Franz Josef would rule for longer than any other European monarch. The 68 years of his reign would be marked by monumental changes in political, economic, social, and cultural life. His prestige would hold together 50 million subjects-including nearly a dozen different peoples with countless conflicting tensions- who made up the polyglot and amorphous realm that was the Austrian Empire.</p></p><h2>Anatomy of Fear: A Novel of Visual Suspense</h2><p><p>Nate Rodriguez is a police sketch artist for the NYPD, and his success rate is high, with one out of three of his drawings leading to an arrest. But when he is faced with an unusually talented killer, he realizes that he may have met his match. For this killer is a man very much like himself&#x2013;a man who sees and thinks in pictures. A killer who leaves drawings at the crime scenes depicting his murders in chilling, gory&#x2013;and prescient&#x2013;detail. </p><p> As Nate's portraits become more and more accurate images of the madman&#x2013;the killer finds a way to steal Nate's portraits and then imitate Nate's own hand. The conflicting evidence leads the police to suspect that Nate himself could be the killer and pushes Nate into a frightening cat and mouse chase for his quarry. Life and death, art and artifice have never been so vividly bound together. </p><p> Jonathan Santlofer pushes the boundaries of the thriller to new heights with this masterful blend of art and suspense. With sequential sketches that alternate throughout the text&#x2013;first the killer's, then Nate's&#x2013;Santlofer teases us with irresistible clues and psychological details delivered in a highly original way.</p></p><p><p>Jonathan Santlofer is the author of five novels and a highly respected artist whose work has been written about and reviewed in the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>Art in America</em>, <em>Artforum</em>, and <em>Arts</em>, and which appears in many public, private, and corporate collections. He lives and works in New York City.</p>A clever graphic element enlivens this solid serial-killer novel from Santolofer, a visual artist and author of three previous art-themed thrillers (<i>The Killing Art</i>, etc.). Nate Rodriguez, a talented NYPD police sketch artist, appears to have psychic abilities when it comes to visualizing perpetrators. When Nate sketches portraits, the drawings are reproduced in the text. Nate joins detective Terri Russo on a case in which the killer, a white supremacist who takes his deadly orders directly from God, leaves his own drawings at the crime scenes (also reproduced). Nate turns to his Puerto Rican grandmother, a <i>santera</i> ("a sort of neighborhood priestess"), for help. Together, they come up with drawings that point to a suspect closer to home than any of them have imagined. Plot devices include a trail of red herring clues that threaten to implicate Nate, overbearing FBI agents and a female-in-peril chase scene at the end, while the romantic relationship that develops between Nate and Terri leaves room for more to come. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

With access to key sources, Bowden takes us inside the rooms where decisions were made and on the ground where the action unfolded.<br><br>After masterminding the attacks of September 11, 2001, Osama bin Laden managed to vanish. Over the next ten years, as Bowden shows, America found that its war with al Qaeda&#x2014;a scattered group of individuals who were almost impossible to track&#x2014;demanded an innovative approach. Step by step, Bowden describes the development of a new tactical strategy to fight this war&#x2014;the fusion of intel from various agencies and on-the-ground special ops. After thousands of special forces missions in Iraq and Afghanistan, the right weapon to go after bin Laden had finally evolved. By Spring 2011, intelligence pointed to a compound in Abbottabad; it was estimated that there was a 50/50 chance that Osama was there. Bowden shows how three strategies were mooted: a drone strike, a precision bombing, or an assault by Navy SEALs. In the end, the President had to make the final decision. It was time for the finish.<br></p><p>While much has been written about the killing of Osama Bin Laden by an elite group of Navy Seals--and much more will be--no account could be more meticulous and balanced than this fascinating report from the author of <em>Black Hawk Down</em>.

Using the metaphor of the Wicked Son at the Passover seder&#x2014;the child who asks, &#x201c;What does this story mean to you?&#x201d;&#x2014;Mamet confronts what he sees as an insidious predilection among some Jews to seek truth and meaning anywhere&#x2014;in other religions, in political movements, in mindless entertainment&#x2014;but in Judaism itself. At the same time, he explores the ways in which the Jewish tradition has long been and still remains the Wicked Son in the eyes of the world. <br><br>Written with the searing honesty and verbal brilliance that is the hallmark of Mamet&#x2019;s work, <i>The Wicked Son</i> is a scathing look at one of the most destructive and tenacious forces in contemporary life, a powerfully thought-provoking and important book.</p><p>David Mamet is a Pulitzer Prize&#x2014;winning playwright. He is the author of <i>Glengarry Glen Ross</i>, <i>The Cryptogram</i>, and <i>Boston Marriage</i>, among other plays. He has also published three novels and many screenplays, children&#x2019;s books, and essay collections.<b>The Four Sons of the Haggadah </b><br><i>The rebbe was plagued by mice. </i><br><i>The mice were eating his books, </i><br><i>and nothing could dissuade them. </i><br><i>He searched in vain for a deterrent. </i><br><i>Until, reading the Shulkhan Arukh, </i><br><i>he came across the statutes governing Passover. </i><br><i>The Shulkhan Arukh unequivocally states </i><br><i>that nothing may be eaten after the afikomen. </i><br><i>So the rebbe crumpled the afikomen </i><br><i>and sprinkled the crumbs over his books. </i><br><i>But the mice were smarter than the rebbe; </i><br><i>first they ate the Shulkhan Arukh, </i><br><i>then they ate the afikomen, </i><br><i>and then they ate his books. </i><br>&#x2014;As told by Rabbi Lawrence Kushner &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>In the section of the Passover Haggadah called &#x201c;The Four Sons,&#x201d; we find &#x201c;What are the laws, the ordinances and the rulings which Hashem has commanded us?&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The answer being, &#x201c;You should inform this child of all the laws of Pesach, including the ruling that nothing should be eaten after the <i>afikomen.</i>&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Passover Haggadah, the Feast of Freedom, the Rabbinical Assembly. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The wise child asks for information, and, in my Haggadah, he receives information, humor, which is to say, welcome to his tradition. His desire to learn and participate is rewarded with love&#x2014;the other sons present their requests as if information were going to cure them of their anomie. Estrangement, hurt, rancor, alienation from the world, can, in the other-than-wise, be misinterpreted as, and assigned to, a failure of their tradition. <br>&nbsp;<br>The second of the four sons, the wicked child, asks &#x201c;What does this ritual mean to <i>you</i>?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>He is wicked in that his question is rhetorical&#x2014;it is not even a request for information; it is an assault. <br>&nbsp;<br>The wicked Jewish child removes himself from his tradition, and sets up as a rationalist and judge of those who would study, learn, and belong. Here is a joke for him. <br>&nbsp;<br>The Minsker apikoros met the Pinsker apikoros. &#x201c;I challenge your claim to preeminence,&#x201d; said the Minsker; &#x201c;defend your excellence as an apikoros. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure I believe in God,&#x201d; said the Pinkser.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;<i>I&#x2019;m </i>not sure <i>I </i>believe in God,&#x201d; replied the Minsker. &#x201c;<i>And </i>I eat pork, I work on Shabbos, and I never go to shul.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You aren&#x2019;t an apikoros,&#x201d; said the Pinsker. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a goy.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>The third son is the simple son, who asks simply, &#x201c;Ma Hu?&#x201d; or &#x201c;What <i>is </i>this?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>We are told to tell him, &#x201c;It is with a mighty hand that Hashem took us out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>A borscht belt joke: Why did the Jews wander forty years in the desert? Because they wouldn&#x2019;t ask directions. <br>&nbsp;<br>This is good, accurate ethnic humor; but it is not true that the Jews wandered forty years. They spent five weeks journeying between the Sea of Reeds and the Jordan River. Where Moses sent out the scouts. The scouts returned and said that the giants inhabited the land, that the scouts looked to themselves as grasshoppers and that they felt that so they must seem in the eyes of the giants. <br>&nbsp;<br>Rabbi Finley teaches that this sin, of lack of faith, this inability to change, kept the Israelites in the desert, until God saw that the generation of the desert had died off, that time had killed the sin of acceptance of Slavery. <br>&nbsp;<br>A new generation had been born that had never seen Egypt, and these people were educable and simple enough to ask, &#x201c;What is this?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>The fourth child is he who does not know how to ask. For him, one is supposed to open the discussion. <br>&nbsp;<br>To the wicked son, who asks, &#x201c;What does all this mean to <i>you</i>?&#x201d; To the Jews who, in the sixties, envied the Black Power Movement; who, in the nineties, envied the Palestinians; who weep at <i>Exodus </i>but jeer at the Israel Defense Forces; who nod when Tevye praises tradition but fidget through the seder; who might take their curiosity to a dogfight, to a bordello or an opium den but find ludicrous the notion of a visit to the synagogue; whose favorite Jew is Anne Frank and whose second-favorite does not exist; who are humble in their desire to learn about Kwanzaa and proud of their ignorance of Tu Bi&#x2019;Shvat; who dread endogamy more than incest; who bow the head reverently at a baptism and have never attended a bris&#x2014;to you, who find your religion and race repulsive, your ignorance of your history a satisfaction, here is a book from your brother.</p><h2>Berthe Morisot : Impressionist</h2><p>With 123 colorplates plus 116 black &amp; white illustrations. Fine condition in fine dust jacket.</p><p>Morisot was a gutsy pioneer among the French impressionists. As a standard-bearer of the avant-garde, she created a scandal by helping to organize a public auction of their works, something very few artists had dared to do. Defying the advice of her parents and Manet, she remained in Paris when Prussian troops besieged the city. In her artistic technique she was no less daring. Around 1874, in pictures of tourists and yacht-filled rivers, she broke through to an abbreviated, shorthand style ahead of her contemporaries. Disregarding her own view that Monet had taken landscape painting to its farthest limits, her late oils of gardens are brilliant fireworks of color. This catalogue of a retrospective exhibition that is to tour the country stands on its own as a valuable study. What it lacks is a sense of the inner woman, a shortcoming that has bedeviled most books about her.

Instructors across the country report that especially at schools where there is a decreased emphasis on literature and the humanities, students do not necessarily see literature as relevant to their lives. They are sometimes totally new to poetry and are often intimidated by it; they sometimes have difficulty approaching and reading a poem and lack confidence in their critical and interpretive abilities. With these factors and students in mind, Meyer has put together an enticing collection of poems from many time periods, cultures, and themes, with voices ranging from the traditional to the hottest contemporary poets, always mixing in plenty of quirky and humorous selections that students will enjoy. Editorial features such as the author's new sample close readings and thematic case studies offer students real help with reading, appreciating, and writing about literature. <i>Poetry</i> is a book designed to make students life-long readers of poetry.</p><p>Michael Meyer (Ph.D., University of Connecticut) has taught writing and literature courses for more than 30 years &#x2014; since 1981 at the University of Connecticut and before that at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte and the College of William and Mary. His scholarly articles have appeared in distinguished journals such as <i>American Literature</i>, <i>Studies in the American Renaissance</i>, and <i>Virginia Quarterly Review</i>. An internationally recognized authority on Henry David Thoreau, Meyer is a former president of the Thoreau Society and coauthor (with Walter Harding) of <i>The New Thoreau Handbook</i>, a standard reference source.

Two South American teenagers are playing Gameboys on a sofa near reception, kicking back in hundred-dollar trainers while Daddy picks up the bill. The older of them swears loudly in Spanish and then catches his brother square on the knot of his shoulder with a dead arm that makes him wince in pain. A passing waiter looks down, shrugs, and empties an ashtray at their table. There&#x2019;s a general atmosphere of listless indifference, of time passing by to no end, the prerush lull of late afternoons.<br>&#x201c;Buenas tardes, se�or.&#x201d;<br>The receptionist is wide shouldered and artificially blond and I play the part of a tourist, making no effort to speak to her in Spanish.<br>&#x201c;Good afternoon. I have a reservation here today.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The name, sir?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Alec Milius.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;<br>She ducks down and taps something into a computer. Then there&#x2019;s a smile, a little nod of recognition, and she writes down my details on a small piece of card.<br>&#x201c;The reservation was made over the Internet?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Could I see your passport please, sir?&#x201d;<br>Five years ago, almost to the day, I spent my first night in Madrid at this same hotel; a twenty-eight-year-old industrial spy on the run from the UK with $189,000 lodged in five separate bank accounts, using three passports and a forged British driving licence for ID. On that occasion I handed a Lithuanian passport issued to me in Paris in August 1997 to the clerk behind the desk. The hotel may have a record of this on their system, so I&#x2019;m using it again.<br>&#x201c;You are from Vilnius?&#x201d; the receptionist asks.<br>&#x201c;My grandfather was born there.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well, breakfast is between seven thirty and eleven o&#x2019;clock and you have it included as part of your rate.&#x201d; It is as if she has no recollection of having asked the question. &#x201c;Is it just yourself staying with us?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Just myself.&#x201d;<br>My luggage consists of a suitcase filled with old newspapers and a leather briefcase containing some toiletries, a laptop computer, and two of my three mobile phones. We&#x2019;re not planning to stay in the room for more than a few hours. A porter is summoned from across the lobby and he escorts me to the lifts at the back of the hotel. He&#x2019;s short and tanned and genial in the manner of low-salaried employees badly in need of a tip. His English is rudimentary, and it&#x2019;s tempting to break into Spanish just to make the conversation more lively.<br>&#x201c;This is being your first time in Madrid, yes?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Second, actually. I visited two years ago.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;For the bullfights?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;On business.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t like the corrida?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not that. I just didn&#x2019;t have the time.&#x201d;<br>The room is situated halfway down a long, Barton Fink corridor on the third floor. The porter uses a credit-card-sized pass key to open the door and places my suitcase on the ground. The lights are operated by inserting the key in a narrow horizontal slot outside the bathroom door, although I know from experience that a credit card works just as well; anything narrow enough to trigger the switch will do the trick. The room is a reasonable size, perfect for our needs, but as soon as I am inside I frown and make a show of looking disappointed and the porter duly asks if everything is all right.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just that I asked for a room with a view over the square. Could you see at the desk if it would be possible to change?&#x201d;<br>Back in 1998, as an overt target conscious of being watched by both American and British intelligence, I ran basic countersurveillance measures as soon as I arrived at the hotel, searching for microphones and hidden cameras. Five years later, I am either wiser or lazier; the simple last-minute switch of room negates any need to sweep. The porter has no choice but to return to reception and within ten minutes I have been assigned a new room on the fourth floor with a clear view over Plaza de Santa Ana. After a quick shower I put on a dressing gown, turn down the air-conditioning, and try to make the room look less functional by folding up the bedspread, placing it in a cupboard, and opening the net curtains so that the decent February light can flood in. It&#x2019;s cold outside, but I stand briefly on the balcony looking out over the square. A neat line of denuded chestnut trees runs east toward the Teatro de Espa�a where a young African man is selling counterfeit CDs from a white sheet spread out on the pavement. In the distance I can see the edge of the Parque Retiro and the roofs of the taller buildings on Calle de Alcal�. It&#x2019;s a typical midwinter afternoon in Madrid: high blue skies, a brisk wind whipping across the square, sunlight on my face. Turning back into the room I pick up one of the mobiles and dial her number from memory.<br>&#x201c;Sof�a?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Hola, Alec.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m in.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What is the number of the room?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Cuatrocientos ocho. Just walk straight through the lobby. There&#x2019;s nobody there and they won&#x2019;t stop you or ask any questions. Keep to the left. The elevators are at the back. Fourth floor.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Is everything OK?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Everything&#x2019;s OK.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Vale,&#x201d; she says.

It is also the story of one man's search for his roots--and, in the end, of his spiritual renewal. Writer Dennis Covington came to this ecstatic form of Christianity as a reporter covering a sensational murder case; Glen Summerford, pastor of the Church of Jesus with Signs Following, had been accused of attempting to kill his wife with rattlesnakes. There, in a courtroom filled with journalists and gawking spectators, Covington felt the pull of a spirituality that was to dominate his life for the next several years. Attending Summerford's church out of curiosity, he soon forged close friendships with some of the worshippers, began attending snake-handling services throughout the South, and eventually took up snakes himself. <p> With subject matter this lurid, <i>Salvation on Sand Mountain</i> could have been a Southern-fried curiosity and little more. Covington goes far deeper. Tracing the snake handlers' roots in regional history, in the deep spiritual alienation of mountain people from the secular modern world they have so recently joined, Covington is more than just sympathetic to the snake handlers; in a profound way, he considers himself one of them. His reasoning is sometimes flawed--when he attempts to find snake handlers in his own family's past, for instance, the result is belabored and unconvincing--but there's no doubt that Covington's heart is in the right place. He's also not without his own brand of sly gallows humor, as in this conversation with the elderly Gracie McAllister: "She'd swore she'd never handle rattlesnakes in July again. She'd been bit the previous two Julys. 'I decided I'd just handle fire and drink strychnine that night,' she said. <i>Good idea</i>, I thought. It always pays to be on the safe side." </p><p> Covington eventually breaks with the snake handlers, but comes away from the experience a changed man. "Knowing where you come from is one thing, but it's suicide to stay there," he writes. An American Book Award winner and finalist for the National Book Award, <i>Salvation on Sand Mountain</i> is a nuanced, compassionate portrait of an unforgettable spiritual journey. <i>--Mary Park</i></p>Dennis Covington teaches creative writing at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.</p><h2>The Shadow, No. 3: The Red Blot and The Voodoo Master</h2><p>Very nice revival of The Shadow.</p><p></p><h2>The Founding Fathers on Leadership: Classic Teamwork in Changing Times</h2><p>Extracts valuable lessons on business leadership from the story of the Founding Fathers&#39; struggle to create a new nation. Shows how figures such as Thomas Paine, James Madison, and Benjamin Franklin faced challenges and dissension in their own ranks with a vision from which they would not stray. Includes checklists of organizational, management, strategic, and leadership lessons learned from the leaders of the American Revolution. Annotation c. by Book News, Inc., Portland, Or.</p><p>When America aspired to break free from Britain, the real-life David-and-Goliath situation required that a full-blown cadre of dynamic leaders arise immediately from the revolutionary populace. As history shows, it did. Now, Donald T. Phillips--writer, speaker, and mayor of Fairview, Texas--uses those events to suggest ways that today's businesspeople can likewise overcome tough odds and achieve success. Goal-setting, communication, and risk-taking, Phillips writes in <i>The Founding Fathers on Leadership: Classic Teamwork in Changing Times</i>, are just a few of the traits to be learned by studying Washington, Jefferson, and their colleagues.Plumbing the depths of history for insight and inspiration is a common practice in management and leadership books, with varying success, as these two titles illustrate. Dunnigan, the author of over a dozen war-related books (e.g., Digital Soldiers, LJ 10/1/96), and software executive Masterson review the business practices and techniques of 12 famous military leaders?Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Charlemagne, Genghis Khan, Edward III, Gustavus Adolphus, Frederick the Great, Napoleon, Ulysses Grant, Douglas MacArthur, George Patton, and Norman Schwarzkopf. Chapters, arranged by leader, include a brief, all-too-casual biography of each, followed by the challenges they faced and the solutions they enacted. Opening and closing chapters try to put the techniques described into a modern perspective, but many of the solutions offered, such as the ruthlessness of Genghis Khan, should have no place in today's corporate culture. Phillips (Lincoln on Leadership, Warner, 1992) uses such Revolutionary War figures as Washington, Jefferson, Paine, Franklin, and John Adams to illuminate concepts of management. Unlike Dunnigan and Masterson, he organizes his chapters by theme, e.g., "Inspire the Masses," "Build Strong Alliances"?using these historical figures and their words where appropriate to illustrate a point. Phillips also provides a bibliography for further reading. While Dunnigan and Masterson's work is not recommended, academic and large public libraries should consider Phillips.?Michael R.

Now, almost a year after the eruption, the survivors seem determined to finish the job. Communities wage war on each other, gangs of cannibals roam the countryside, and what little government survived the eruption has collapsed completely. The ham radio has gone silent. Sickness, cold, and starvation are the survivors&#39; constant companions. When it becomes apparent that their home is no longer safe and adults are not facing the stark realities, Alex and Darla must create a community that can survive the ongoing disaster, an almost impossible task requiring even more guts and more smarts than ever--and unthinkable sacrifice. If they fail . . . they, their loved ones, and the few remaining survivors will perish. This epic finale has the heart of Ashfall, the action of Ashen Winter, and a depth all its own, examining questions of responsibility and bravery, civilization and society, illuminated by the story of an unshakable love that transcends a post-apocalyptic world and even life itself.</p><p>Mike Mullin first discovered he could make money writing in sixth grade.

Over the course of the next two and a half years, an insecure, chaotic and troubled young woman was transformed into someone who inspired those with whom she shared the suffering of the transit camp at Westerbork and with whom she eventually perished at Auschwitz. Through her diary and letters, she continues to inspire those whose lives she has touched since. She was an extraordinarily alive and vivid young woman who shaped and lived a spirituality of hope in the darkest period of the twentieth century. This book explores Etty Hillesum's life and writings, seeking to understand what it was about her that was so remarkable, how her journey developed, how her spirituality was shaped, and what her profound reflections on the roots of violence and the nature of evil can teach us today.</p></p><p>Patrick Woodhouse is Canon Precentor of Wells Cathedral where he has responsibility for music and liturgy.

Taking up where the very popular <i>Potager</i> left off, <i>In the French Kitchen Garden </i>is a lovingly written, beautifully illustrated guide to cultivating a potager. Georgeanne Brennan imparts her passion for the potager while offering advice on adapting a kitchen garden to any climate or space. Punctuated with impromptu recipes for delicious dishes incorporating the fresh produce of each season, this book encourages everyone to adopt ?the creative, relaxed style of the French country cook.</p><p>Georgeanne Brennan became enamored of the concept of the <i>potager</i>, or kitchen garden, while living in the south of France, and has created potagers everywhere she's lived in the nearly three decades since then. The potager, explains Brennan, is more than a garden: it's a chance to observe the seasons, a provider of ingredients for signature local dishes, and a great social democratizer that keeps neighbors in touch as they share their bounty with each other.<p> One of the main features of a potager is that it is intended as a year-round garden, rather than just a summer, or harvest, garden. To that end, Brennan explains which plants do well in different seasons and how to stagger the plantings during seasonal transition periods so as to use the space efficiently throughout the year. The garden itself can be quite small--9 feet by 12 feet can keep a family of four in fresh produce. Like a potager, this guide is small and sweet. It's attractively illustrated with Melissa Sweet's watercolors, and includes 25 easy recipes that make stars of simple, fresh ingredients. <i>--Barrie Trinkle</i></p>Georgeanne Brennan is a James Beard Award-winning author of numerous cooking and garden books.

Among the jewels&nbsp;&nbsp;gathered here are Gertrude offering Hamlet a piece&nbsp;&nbsp;of her mind, the real truth about the Little Red&nbsp;&nbsp;Hen, a reincarnated bat explaining how Bram Stoker&nbsp;&nbsp;got <i>Dracula</i> all wrong, and the&nbsp;&nbsp;five methods of making a man (such as the&nbsp;&nbsp;"Traditional Method": "Take some dust off&nbsp;&nbsp;the ground. Form. Breathe into the nostrils the&nbsp;&nbsp;breath of life. Simple, but effective!")&nbsp;&nbsp;There are parables, monologues, prose poems, condensed&nbsp;&nbsp;science fiction, reconfigured fairy tales, and&nbsp;&nbsp;other miniature masterpieces--punctuated with&nbsp;&nbsp;charming illustrations by the author. A must for her&nbsp;&nbsp;fans, and a wonderful gift for all who savor the art&nbsp;&nbsp;of exquisite prose, <i>Good Bones And Simple&nbsp;&nbsp;Murders</i> marks the first time these&nbsp;&nbsp;writings have been available in a trade edition in the&nbsp;&nbsp;United States.</p><p>This handsome volume combines two of Margaret Atwood's most playful books--<i>Good Bones</i> and <i>Murder in the Dark</i>--resulting in an athletically clever series of tiny fictions, prose poems, and essays that, in small, witty steps, deconstruct everything from sexual politics to the very act of writing itself. Ranging from a tongue-in-cheek appreciation of "Women's Novels" and an embittered, self-sacrificing confessional by Chicken Little to a powerful series of variations on John McCrae's "In Flanders Fields," <i>Good Bones and Simple Murders</i> will surprise casual Atwood fans who are accustomed to the broad intensity of her novels or the seriousness of much of her poetry.<p> Many of the weaker pieces in this collection now feel dated, but this is hardly Atwood's fault; scores of lesser writers worked the brief essay-fiction to death in the late '90s, but <i>Good Bones and Simple Murders</i> is the real thing. Atwood is blessed with the linguistic gifts necessary to make this kind of writing memorable and a keen intelligence that often gives the stories a devastating relevance. These stories are too quirky to be a useful introduction to Atwood's works, but they are nonetheless likely to delight both fans and dabblers. <i>--Jack Illingworth</i></p>"[Atwood] proves she is an accomplished miniaturist...She can pack more wallop into less space than any other writer in her weight class."<br>--<i>Toronto Globe and Mail</i><br></p><h2>Desperate and Deceptive: The Guinevere Jones Collection Volume 1</h2><p><b><i>The Desperate Game</i> and<i> The Chilling Deception</i>, together for the first time!</b><br><br><b>Meet Guinevere Jones&#x2014;a woman with a talent for love and trouble&#x2014;and Zac Justis&#x2014;her sexy and dangerous partner in crime&#x2014;in the first two books in the<i> New York Times</i> bestselling series.</b><br><br><i>The Desperate Game</i><br><br>It&#x2019;s hard to keep a small business afloat&#x2014;just ask Guinevere Jones, owner of a struggling temp agency.

I don't carry a briefcase. I try not to schedule too many meetings. I leave my door open. . . . I prefer to come to work each day and just see what develops." <br>Even a maverick plays by rules, and here Trump formulates his own eleven guidelines for success. He isolates the common elements in his greatest deals; he shatters myths ("You don't necessarily need the best location. What you need is the best deal"); he names names, spells out the zeros, and fully reveals the deal-maker's art: from the abandoned property that became the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center to the seedy hotel that became the Grand Hyatt; from the race to rebuild Central Park's Wollman Skating Rink to the byzantine saga of the property that became Trump Tower.

History Bk Club. UP.</p><p>"The Bill of Rights stands as the high temple of our constitutional order--America's Parthenon--and yet we lack a clear view of it," Akhil Reed Amar writes in his introduction to <i>The Bill of Rights</i>. "Instead of being studied holistically, the Bill has been broken up ... with each segment examined in isolation." With <i>The Bill of Rights</i>, Amar aims to put the pieces back together and take a longer view of a document few Americans truly understand. Part history of the Bill, part analysis of what the Founding Fathers' intentions really were, this book provides a unique interpretation of the Constitution. It is Amar's hypothesis that, contrary to popular belief, the Bill of Rights was not originally constructed to protect the minority against the majority, but rather to empower popular majorities. It wasn't until 19th-century post-Civil War reconstruction and the introduction of the 14th Amendment that the notion of individual rights took hold. Prior to that, the various amendments to the Constitution that make up the Bill of Rights were more about the <i>structure</i> of government and designed to protect citizens against a self-interested regime.

Within its shell is contained all the archetypical connections humanity has ever held with life, death, and life renewed. This eternal cycle of rebirth at spring is a major theme in the spring holidays of virtually every one of the world&#x2019;s religions, from the most ancient Pagan expressions of spirituality to the most modern sects of Christianity. <br>How did the egg&#x2015;particularly the chicken egg&#x2015;get appointed to this lofty position of symbolizing a universe full of new life? Like many of our modern holiday customs, the egg&#x2019;s place in spring spiritual rites is derived from the way our ancestors observed the natural world around them and honored their deities through these natural occurrences. With modern refrigeration, factory farming, and a fast-moving global marketplace making a variety of food abundant to us year round, it&#x2019;s hard for us to fully comprehend that food was once a seasonal commodity that was impossible to obtain when the natural conditions allowing it to be produced were unavailable. <br>The eyes of a laying hen and the amount of light she receives are the components responsible for her ability to produce eggs. A hen lays eggs when the retina, the part of the eye that captures light and images, is stimulated for periods of twelve hours or more by sunlight. When that light stimulation ends, so does her laying cycle. Because fire, the only source of light for our ancestors, was not a strong enough light to fool the hen&#x2019;s retina, there were no fresh eggs for a full six months out of every year. <br>Though the scientific connection between light stimulation and laying cycles would be not known for many more centuries, their laying pattern was still reliable. Hens could be counted on to begin producing fresh eggs at the spring equinox and cease producing them around the autumnal equinox, a holiday period associated with dying and death and imagery opposite that of Ostara. As the world bloomed and greened anew each Ostara, the abundance of fresh eggs made them a natural symbol of new life. <br>In Asia, red-colored eggs are on occasion offered at funerals and births to symbolize the natural cycles of life, death, and rebirth. In the Ukraine, eggs called krashanka&#x2015;sometimes dyed in shades of bright yellow&#x2015;are eaten to celebrate the rebirth of the sun. More elaborate eggs, called pysanky, are decorated to use as talismans of fertility, prosperity, and protection. In places as diverse as west-central Africa and the southern Appalachian Mountains of the United States, eggs are buried near cemeteries to encourage reincarnation. <br>Rebirthing Spell <br>Gently place one egg in a pan that is half-filled with boiling water. As you watch the egg boil in the steaming pot, concentrate on something you feel is gone from your life that you wish to have manifest back into it. Conceptualize this desire as living within the egg, a need that will be birthed into being with the egg&#x2019;s assistance. Visualize this miracle happening with as much clarity and detailas you are able. Do this for at least five minutes, then remove the pan from the heat and allow it to cool. <br>When the egg is able to be handled, take crayons or felt markers in any color or colors you feel best represents your desire and draw a symbol or some other representation of your wish on the egg. <br>Bury the egg near your front door, as deep as is reasonable. Each time you walk past the place where the egg is buried, be sure to remind yourself of its purpose by restating to yourself an affirmation of your desire. <br>In a short time the egg will break down, the shell cracking open and the yolk decomposing. This symbolic life, death, and rebirth of your wishing egg is linked by magick to your life, and it will help your desire to be rebirthed soon. <br>Eostre&#x2019;s Eggs and the <br>Legend of the Easter Bunny <br>The Anglo-Saxons hailed Eostre as the Goddess of Spring, the Greening Earth, and Fertility. Her name means &#x201c;moving with the waxing sun.&#x201d; Around the time of her festival, on the day when light and dark are equal, the local animals began giving birth or going into their sexually receptive cycles, named &#x201c;estrus periods&#x201d; after the goddess. From the fiercest to the most humble, the woodland animals&#x2015;who also worshipped and loved Eostre&#x2015;would play in the warmth of spring light and feast on the new vegetation Eostre provided. <br>One of Eostre&#x2019;s devotees was a small hare who wished very much to give a gift to his goddess, but he didn&#x2019;t know what he could possibly offer that would be of any value to her. Then one day while foraging, the hare came across a fresh egg, a very prized commodity indeed. The little hare wanted very badly to eat the egg, as it had been a long time since he&#x2019;d feasted on anything finer than dry grasses. Before he could take a bite of his prize, he realized this egg might make the perfect gift for Eostre. But, he pondered, Eostre could have all the eggs she wanted, anytime she wanted them. She was a goddess, a creator, the embodiment of Life itself. Giving her just any egg would never do. How, he wondered, could he make this egg a fit offering for his goddess? <br>The little hare took the egg home and pondered how to make it as beautiful and new as Eostre made the world each spring. He began to decorate the egg. He painted it in the hues of Eostre&#x2019;s spring woods and placed upon the shell symbols sacred to Eostre. When he felt he could not make the egg any more beautiful, he took it to Eostre and offered it to her. <br>Eostre was so pleased by the little hare&#x2019;s sacrifice of his egg to her, and by the manner in which he decorated it for her, that she wanted everyone&#x2015;especially children, who are themselves symbols of new life&#x2015;to enjoy these representations of her bounty. Since that Ostara day long ago, the descendants of that hare have taken up the task of delivering decorated eggs to the world&#x2019;s children at spring. They are called Eostre&#x2019;s Bunnies or, more commonly, the Easter Bunny. <br>Decorating Eostre&#x2019;s Eggs <br>The egg decorating and gifting custom long ago emerged in the modern West from the Teutonic traditions in which Eostre was first honored. Today, spring egg-decorating kits are numerous and inexpensive, and many adherents of the world&#x2019;s Christianreligions decorate them in celebration of the resurrection of their savior deity, Jesus. <br>Many modern Pagans and Witches like to use natural dyes for their Eostre&#x2019;s eggs, sometimes called Ostara eggs, since Ostara is often cited as a Greek translation of Eostre&#x2019;s name. Natural dyes rarely produce a color as dark and rich as the commercially prepared dyes, and some finishes tend to scratch or rub off. They are derived from plants just like natural fabric dyes and, like these dyes, require more preparation and dying time than needed when using commercial dye kits. By using the materials nature provides, though, you will be coloring eggs as they were done in the past. Also, the use of natural herbs can be used to help empower specific eggs to assist with specific magickal tasks. <br>To make your own natural dyes you will need a generous fistful of herbs or plants that produce colored stains, a small- to medium-sized saucepan, and a wooden spoon. Glass saucepans are best, as metal can become irrevocably stained by natural dyes. <br>Place about three cups of water in the pan and allow it to come to a low boil; add the plant material and stir occasionally so that the water becomes a very deep version of your desired shade. The color the eggs take on will always be significantly paler and you may need to add, boil, strain, and repeat to get the darker shades you desire. When you have the water the shade you want, strain the plant material out of the water, return the water to the pan, and bring the water to a light simmer. Add to it a pinch of salt, a tablespoon or two of vinegar, and a couple tablespoons of cream of tartar. Mix these in well. Remove from heat, and place eggs in the dye until they attain the desired hue. <br>I have not personally experimented with all the dye sources listed below, but I have had experience with a great deal of them. The others I know of from contact with people who have tried them. But don&#x2019;t let this list limit you in any way. Playing with natural dyes is fun. Feel free to experiment with any nontoxic plant source to which you have no allergy to see how a dye made from it might turn out. Sometimes the resulting color will be a delightful surprise. <br>Natural Dye Sources and Colors <br>Source Color <br>White Grapes Pale Yellow <br>Carrot Tops Yellow <br>Turmeric Yellow <br>Vanilla Extract Yellow Orange <br>Daffodil Blossoms Yellow Green <br>Dandelions Orange <br>Onions Orange <br>Orris Root Rusty Orange <br>Paprika Orange Brown <br>Heather Pink <br>Madder Root Red <br>Blackberries Red Violet <br>Bracken Green <br>Red Cabbage Robin&#x2019;s Egg Blue <br>Iris Blossoms Pinkish Blue <br>Blueberries Blue <br>Black Raspberries Blue <br>Beets Blue Violet <br>Mulberries Blue Violet <br>Cayenne Rust <br>The symbolic image of the egg is almost as important as its organic aspect, so don&#x2019;t overlook using &#x201c;eggs&#x201d; crafted from wood, foam, or plastic. All can be painted with nontoxic watercolor or acrylic paints or covered with seasonal decals. You may decorate eggs with faces, symbols, or any other idea that captures your fancy. With a few trinkets or decorative items found in craft stores, and some school glue, you can add sequins, beads, fake gemstones, glitter, or feathering to make Ostara eggs say just how you feel about the season, your goddess and god, or about the person to whom you will be offering them. <br>Above all else, bear in mind that there is no wrong way to decorate your Ostara eggs. If they appeal to you as symbols of the season, that&#x2019;s all that matters. However, you may want to keep in mind as you decorate that the colors you choose have meaning in both the archetypical and magickal sense. <br>Yellow � This is the color of creativity, mind power, intellectual pursuits, communication, and the solar plexus region of the body. It is also associated with the sun and with egg yolks. <br>Orange � Orange is another solar color. It is used in spells for attraction and friendship. Spells for willpower often use orange, as this is the color of the navel-area energy center, called a chakra, the area in the body governing personal desire and drive. <br>Red � Red is the color of blood, and this fact links it symbolically with the cycles of life, death, and rebirth. In the Greek Orthodox Church, eggs dyed deep red are used to decorate altars in homes and churches, and are given away as gifts after the traditional Easter Eve church service. The Druid priests of the Celtic tribes were reputed to have used red eggs in a similar manner. Red is also the color of desire, courage, lust, sexuality, war, and strength, and represents the womb blood of the Mother Goddess from which all things are born. <br>Green � This is the color of the Earth Mother in spring and summer. It represents abundance, prosperity, personal appearance, and fertility. Spells to neutralize difficult situations or induce calm often employ green. Green is linked to the energy center around the heart, so it&#x2019;s a natural that spells for love of all types work well under green&#x2019;s influence. <br>Blue � Blue represents sleep and dreams, peace and healing, and fidelity and unity, and is frequently employed in spells for dream magick and astral projection. Its paler shades are often associated with the coming of spring and with virgin goddesses. <br>Violet � This is the color of intense spirituality, metaphysical mysteries, deep sleep, the healing of serious illnesses, the uncovering of past lives, and of communicating with higher-level beings. This is also the color of the crown chakra of the body, which is activated when we seek a connection with the divine. <br>White � White is used in healing and purification spells and rituals. It is always perfect as an all-purpose color substitute when no other color feels quite right. <br>Brown � Brown represents the Earth and its animals, and is often used in connection with stone magick to help the inner self connect to the rhythms and energies of the Earth. <br>Black � Contrary to its reputation, black is not a color of evil or negativity. It represents mysteries, voids, and the Crone Goddess, and is used in spells to absorb and dispel negative influences. Though not a popular Ostara color, black should never be summarily dismissed as a magickal color choice when decorating eggs for spells or ritual. Even though it is associated with death in the West, it is symbolic of life in many parts of the East&#x2015;and it should be remembered at Ostara that new life may only come from death, be it physical or metaphoric. <br>Pink � Like all pastels, pink is associated with spring. It is used primarily in spells and rituals for household peace and romantic love. <br>Silver � Silver represents the moon, the Goddess, psychicism, and the inner self. <br>Gold � Gold can represent the solar deities, both male and female. It is also used in summer festivals, in rituals to honor the sun, and in spells for wealth and employment. <br>Making Cascarones <br>Did being hit over the head ever seem like a blessing to you? It would if you lived in the American Southwest, where the Latino people have adapted a lovely Easter egg custom with Pagan origins into their spring celebrations. They bless you by knocking you in the head with special eggs known as cascarones. Cascarones (pronounced cahs-cah-ROE-nays) are eggshells that have been collected for many weeks prior to Easter and carefully hollowed out. They are then decorated and filled with a variety of substances that will shower over their recipients when cracked over their heads. Common cascarone fillers include confetti, lavender, sage, perfumed herbs, and flour or cornmeal. Though the idea now is more one of playfulness, it was once a very real tool for making magick and offering the blessings of the equinox to others. <br>Items you will need to make your own cascarones include eggs and some clear carton-sealing tape. You will also need bowls to catch the inside of the eggs as you hollow out the shells; colorful items with which to decorate your eggs, such as paints and decals; and some herbs or confetti with which to fill out the empty shells. A small kitchen funnel can also be useful to have on hand. <br>Start by emptying the eggs. Make a small hole in both ends of the egg (I use a fork tine) and, with the narrow end down, gently blow the contents into the waiting bowl. Wash out the empty shells with cold water and let dry. Paint and decorate the shells before filling them. The filling is done by taping up the smallest hole and using a small funnel in the larger hole to channel your desired contents into the egg. Be careful not to fill the shell more than three-quarters full or it will not break well and could be solid enough to hurt the recipient of your attention. When full, seal the other end with clear tape and store in a cool, dry place until Ostara morning. <br>A Cascarone Love Spell <br>Following the instructions given above, make a cascarone and fill it with magickal herbs associated with attracting romantic love. These include lavender, yarrow, apple blossom, rose petals, daisies, lemon verbena, willow, or rosemary. Copal can be added too&#x2015;this is a popular herb in Mexican folk magick. You may also want to toss in some herbs that help create a lusty atmosphere, such as cloves, cinnamon, dill, or damiana. <br>As you create the cascarone, visualize the contents as catalysts that will allow your desired lover to notice you more intently without impinging on his or her free will to choose a lover. On Ostara you can either ...</p><h2>The Littlest Pumpkin</h2><p>When Bartlett&#39;s Farm Stand closes for the season, the Littlest Pumpkin, who longs to make someone happy for Halloween, is devastated to be the only pumpkin left, but when a group of mice come along, they make the Littlest Pumpkin the happiest pumpkin in the world!

The first response was no ("A most respectful demurring by me for the excellent writer Charles J. Shields, who offered to be my biographer"). Unwilling to take no for an answer, propelled by a passion for his subject, and already deep into his research, Shields wrote again and this time, to his delight, the answer came back: "O.K."

Vonnegut re</p><p><p><strong>An Interview with Amazon</strong></p> <p>Charles Shields is a writer who writes about writers. He previously penned a bestselling biography of Harper Lee, and now he's written the definitive portrait of Kurt Vonnegut, chronicling Vonnegut's slow and often difficult path to the upper ranks of American literature.</p> <p>It's not always a pretty portrait. "Kurt wanted to be a writer from the time he was a teenager," Shields told me. But after serving in the military, getting married and having kids, he faced a dreary life behind a desk "which is not the kind of artistic one that he thought he'd have."</p> <p>Yet the truth about writers is just that: they don't often live the exciting, public lifestyles of a Hemmingway or a Mailer. Most toil in solitary exclusion. It's a desk job in an office of one. It's sedentary, quiet, and often dull. Still, Shields is fascinated by the process of writing, and by the power and reach of the written word, which he discovered at age 15 upon earning a byline for his first high school newspaper story.&nbsp;"That was a magical moment for me," he said.</p> <p>Shields has worked since to grow and change, to learn from others. That desire led him to study other writers and eventually to become a biographer, joining a group he admiringly refers to as "snoops" and "gossips." (Shields is co-founder of Biographers International Organization.)</p> <p>When he learned Vonnegut was miffed that no one had tried to write his biography, Shields reached out. He was rebuffed, persisted, and finally received a postcard on which Vonnegut had sketched a self-portrait, smoking a cigarette. The card contained two letters: "OK."</p> <p>Shields began working with Vonnegut in 2006. A year later, after a two-hour interview session at Vonnegut's Manhattan brownstone, Shields left, returning the next day to learn from the housekeeper that Vonnegut was in a coma. He had gotten tangled in his dog's leash and fell off his front steps, hitting his head. He died a month later at age 84. </p> <p>"It's too trite to say that it was a shock," Shields said. "I felt a kind of&#x2026; I felt sort of separate from myself for a little bit. Because I had invested a lot in this, and I had come to like him. And now suddenly, after dubbing me his biographer, he was gone."</p> <p>Shields&#x2019;s biography was saved by the discovery of 1,500 letters to or from Vonnegut, which had been presumed lost. "So, going on my interviews with him, and all of these long, intimate letters that he wrote, I was able to construct what I felt was a very authentic, personal portrait of this man as writer, father, struggling freelancer, suddenly famous man, divorced parent, divorced husband, over the course of more than fifty years," Shields said.</p><p><b>Charles J.

Winner&#x2014;a leading writer at the crossroads of culture and spirituality and author of <em>Still</em> and<em> Girl Meets God</em>&#x2014;joins the ranks of luminaries such as Anne Lamott and Barbara Brown Taylor with this exploration of little known&#x2014;and, so, little used&#x2014;biblical metaphors for God, metaphors which can open new doorways for our lives and spiritualities.</p><p>There are hundreds of metaphors for God, but the church only uses a few familiar images: creator, judge, savior, father. In <em>Wearing God</em>, Lauren Winner gathers a number of lesser-known tropes, reflecting on how they work biblically and culturally, and reveals how they can deepen our spiritual lives.</p><p>Exploring the notion of God as clothing, Winner reflects on how we are &#x201c;clothed with Christ&#x201d; or how &#x201c;God fits us like a garment.&#x201d; She then analyzes how clothing functions culturally to shape our ideals and identify our community, and ruminates on how this new metaphor can function to create new possibilities for our lives. For each biblical metaphor&#x2014;God as the vine/vintner who animates life; the lactation consultant; and the comedian, showing us our follies, for example&#x2014;Winner surveys the historical, literary, and cultural landscapes in order to revive and heal our souls.</p></p><p><p>"Around five years ago, I began to realize that my pictures of God were old. This intersected, not coincidentally, with my newfound wakefulness to the scriptures, and it led me on a search: what pictures, what images and metaphors, does the Bible give us for who God is, and what ways of being with God might those pictures invite?</p><p>"One of the invitations of this book&#x2014;and, I think, of the Bible&#x2014;is this: you can discover things about God by looking around your ordinary, everyday life. There is a method here, and it is Jesus's method. Jesus, after all, specialized in asking people to steep themselves in the words of the scriptures and then to look around their ordinary Tuesdays to see what they could see about holiness and life with God. This is not merely entertaining wordplay to give overactive minds something pious to do. It is the Bible's way of making us aware of God and of the world in which we meet God."</p><p>&#x2014;from <em>Wearing God</em></p><p>So begins a wise and lyrical journey as scholar and Episcopal priest Lauren Winner tries on overlooked metaphors for how we meet and experience God. Chapters on God as clothing, laughter, flame, food, wine, and a laboring woman not only invite us to understand God in a new way, but each reveals God to be much closer and more intimate than we imagine, opening up the opportunity for experiencing and knowing God more deeply. If God has felt distant or absent, or if your reading of scripture has become cold or rote, reading <em>Wearing God</em> can serve as the hymn that revives you.</p><p>Lauren F.

C. Grayling</strong></p> Already a classic in its first year of publication, this landmark study of Western thought takes a fresh look at the writings of the great thinkers of classic philosophy and questions many pieces of conventional wisdom. The book invites comparison with Bertrand Russell's monumental <em>History of Western Philosophy</em>, "but Gottlieb's book is less idiosyncratic and based on more recent scholarship" (Colin McGinn, <em>Los Angeles Times</em>). A <em>New York Times</em> Notable Book, a <em>Los Angeles Times</em> Best Book, and a <em>Times Literary Supplement</em> Best Book of 2001.</p><p>Writing a history of more than 2,000 years of philosophy is no mean feat, and writing it in fewer than 500 pages of intelligent but graceful prose is more difficult still. Yet this is just what Anthony Gottlieb accomplishes in <i>The Dream of Reason</i>, which guides the reader from the earliest Greek philosophers to the pre-Cartesian Renaissance. Gottlieb's project is undeniably ambitious, and by necessity it is big-picture philosophy. But it is exactly this big-picture context that is often lamentably absent from other works of this sort. Gottlieb's skill at rendering historical context makes his account both unusually engaging and surprisingly illuminating. <p> Gottlieb is an admirable guide through the little-understood pre-Socratic philosophers of ancient Greece, giving fair measure to philosophers who are too often simplified or lampooned. His account of Plato and Aristotle is good too, as is his treatment of the later Hellenistic schools, Epicureanism, Stoicism, and Skepticism. Gottlieb's treatment of medieval philosophy, particularly Thomist and Arabic philosophy, is lean, as the author chooses to focus more heavily on antiquity and the modern era (to be continued in a second volume), and the narrative history that bridges the two. Ever enthusiastic, Gottlieb's storytelling voice and character-driven approach make <i>The Dream of Reason</i> compelling reading. It is an ideal book for nonexperts interested in an appealing and informative history of philosophy as well as for students looking for a lucid and comprehensive account of premodern thinkers. <i>--Eric de Place</i></p>Anthony Gottlieb is the author of The Dream of Reason, a former executive editor of The Economist, and has held visiting fellowships at Harvard University and All Souls College, Oxford.

As the old coal carrier sank, chief mate Bob Cusick watched his crew&#x2013;his friends and colleagues&#x2013;succumb to the frigid forty-foot waves and subzero winds of the Atlantic. Of the thirty-four men aboard, Cusick was one of only three to survive. And he soon found himself facing the most critical decision of his life: whether to stand by the Merchant Marine officers&#x2019; unspoken code of silence, or to tell the truth about why his crew and hundreds of other lives had been unnecessarily sacrificed at sea.<br> <br>Like many other ships used by the Merchant Marine, the Marine Transport Line's <i>Marine Electric</i> was very old and made of &#x201c;dirty steel&#x201d; (steel with excess sulfur content). Many of these vessels were in terrible condition and broke down frequently. Yet the government persistently turned a blind eye to the potential dangers, convinced that the economic return on keeping these ships was worth the risk. <br>Cusick chose to blow the whistle.<br><i><br>Until the Sea Shall Free Them</i> re-creates in compelling detail the wreck of the <i>Marine Electric</i> and the legal drama that unfolded in its wake. With breathtaking immediacy, Robert Frump, who covered the story for the <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i>, describes the desperate battle waged by the crew against the forces of nature. Frump also brings to life Cusick's internal struggle. He knew what happened to those who spoke out against the system, knew that he too might be stripped of his license and prosecuted for "losing his ship," yet he forged ahead. In a bitter lawsuit with owners of the ship, Cusick emerged victorious. His expose of government inaction led to vital reforms in the laws regarding the safety of ships; his courageous stand places him among the unsung heroes of our time.</p><p>"This is a story told with riveting intensity. Frump captures both the cruel sea and the determination of a group of individuals who worked together to fix a broken system.

The period covered ranges from about 1895 to 1930. Artists include Julia Morgan and Dick van Erp.</p><p>&#34;The best work in Arts and Crafts in America is already being produced on the Pacific Coast&#34;, proclaimed the English designer Charles R. Ashbee during a visit to the Bay Area in 1909. The accuracy of his praise is made vividly clear by this handsome publication, whiCh celebrates the beauty, skill, variety, and exuberance of the Arts and Crafts objects and architecture created in California during a brief but intensely prolific period between about 1895 and 1930. Inspired by the state&#39;s spectacular scenery, by its distinctive flora and fauna, and by its romantic past, the artists and artisans of California produced a unique variant of the Arts and Crafts movement. This ground-breaking book - which accompanies a major exhibition organized by The Oakland Museum - takes as its starting point the movement&#39;s ideal of &#34;the good life&#34;, in which the virtues of simple living and high thinking were complemented by material well-being. Enlightening and entertaining essays by eight astute scholars present new information and insights about Arts and Crafts architecture and urban planning, garden design, interiors and resorts, tiles, pottery, metalwork, and furniture. Thoughtful introductory and closing essays analyze the movement and its visual and conceptual legacies in the context of that beguilingly idealistic era. Concluding the book are information-rich endnotes and a carefully focused bibliography, plus extensive artists&#39; biographies and company histories that will be of particular interest to both scholars and collectors.Developed in Britain in the second half of the 19th century, the Arts and Crafts Movement flourished in a unique regional variant in California from about 1895 to 1930. Rich in inspiration, artists reflected the climate, landscape, and the region's Spanish and Mexican heritage in their subjects and in decorative designs in pottery, furniture, and metalwork. In this volume, scholars chronicle this regional development and offer insights into the movement in nine essays that detail garden and interior designs; architecture; tiles; the movement in the San Francisco Bay Area, the Southland, and San Diego; and its eventual decline. Notes, artists' biographies, company histories, and a bibliography complete this focused study of a prolific period in the visual arts of California.

Destruction of the Father ;the title comes fromthe name of a sculpture she did following the death of her husband in1973 ;contains both formal texts and what the artist calls"pen-thoughts": drawing-texts often connected to her drawings andsculptures, with stories or poems inscribed alongside the images.Writing is a means of expression that has gained increasing importancefor Bourgeois, particularly during periods of insomnia. The writing iscompulsive, but it can also be perfectly controlled, informed by herintellectual background, knowledge of art history, and sense ofliterary form (she has frequently published articles on artists,exhibitions, and art events). Bourgeois, a private woman "withoutsecrets," has given numerous interviews to journalists, artists, andwriters, expressing her views on her oeuvre, revealing its hiddenmeanings, and relating the connection of certain works to the traumasof her childhood. This book collects both her writings and her spokenremarks on art, confirming the deep links between her work and herbiography and offering new insights into her creative process.</p></p><p>Hans Ulrich Obrist is a Swiss-born curator and writer. He is the co-director of exhibitions and programs and the co-director of international projects at the Serpentine Galleries, London. His previous books include &#34;A Brief History of Curating&#34;;&#34; &#34;A&#34; Brief History of New Music&#34;;&#34; Everything You Always Wanted to Ask About Curating But Were Afraid to Ask&#34;;&#34; Sharp Tongues, Loose Lips, Open Eyes, Ears to the Ground;&#34; &#34;Ai Weiwei Speaks&#34;, &#34; &#34;and nearly thirty volumes of his Conversation Series of interviews with contemporary artists.This collection of writings and statements by sculptor Bourgeois includes letters, journal entries, poetry, and interviews with the artist spanning the entire period from her student days to just last year. The impression created is one of lifelong preoccupation with a set of personal concerns that, as curator Bernadac says in the introduction, reflect "the fundamental dichotomy between professional control and spontaneity, between the conscious and the unconscious, between the expression that is structured, assembled, and thought through, and the expression that is presented raw, as the product of an urgent impulse." Readers not already familiar with Bourgeois's work will appreciate the small photographs of sculptures, drawings, and prints included.

His many acclaimed books on World War II include <i>Why the Allies Won</i> and <i>The Battle of Britain.</i>Comparisons between Hitler and Stalin and their regimes are nothing new, but this dense, comprehensive, scholarly investigation is more nuanced than most. Overy sidesteps the simplistic debate over which dictator was more evil and focuses on how they, and the systems they created, were similar and different. He delves into their regimes thematically, in topics ranging from police states and economic systems to wartime behavior. The results yield intriguing historical insights, although the book demands a careful reading. For instance, Overy notes that both Hitler and Stalin created cults of personality, but for Hitler "personality was the defining criterion of leadership"; Stalin, on the other hand, emphasized Communist ideology first and embraced a personality cult only when he realized it could cement his stranglehold on power. Interestingly, while the Nazi Party increasingly relied on workers' support and ideology, Stalin's Communist Party&#x2014;the "vanguard of the proletariat"&#x2014;relied more and more on middle-class technocrats. At times Overy restates points long known to historians, e.g., both leaders pursued negative utopias, but from different bases: class warfare was Stalin's justification, while Hitler chose biological purity. But when he points out the differences in their policies toward minorities and nationalities&#x2014;Hitler adhered to a racial ladder, while Stalin, a Georgian, flip-flopped to suit his political goals&#x2014;Overy's analytical strength and depth of knowledge emerges. 32 pages illus.; maps. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Author Po Bronson was asking himself that very question when he decided to write this book&#x2014;an inspiring exploration of how people transform their lives and a template for how we can answer this question for ourselves.<br><br>Bronson traveled the country in search of individuals who have struggled to find their calling, their true nature&#x2014;people who made mistakes before getting it right. He encountered people of all ages and all professions&#x2014;a total of fifty-five fascinating individuals trying to answer questions such as: Is a career supposed to feel like a destiny? How do I tell the difference between a curiosity and a passion? Should I make money first, to fund my dream? If I have a child, will my frustration over my work go away? Should I accept my lot, make peace with my ambition, and stop stressing out? Why do I feel guilty for thinking about this? <br><br>From their efforts to answer these questions, the universal truths in this book emerge. Each story in these pages informs the next, and the result is a journey that unfolds with cumulative power. Reading this book is like listening in on an intimate conversation among people you care about and admire. Even if you know what you should do with your life, you will find wisdom and guidance in these stories of people who found meaningful answers by daring to be honest with themselves. <br>Among them:<br> <br>-the Pittsburgh lawyer who decided to become a trucker so he could savor the moment and be closer to his son. <br>-the toner-cartridge queen of Chicago, who realized that her relationships with men kept sabotaging her career choices.<br>-the Cuban immigrant who overcame the strong dis-approval of her parents and quit her high-paying job to pursue social-service work in Miami.<br>-the chemistry professor who realized, quite late in life, that he would rather practice law.<br>-the mother torn between an Olympic career and her adolescent daughter.<br>-the seventeen-year-old boy who received a letter from the Dalai Lama and was called to a life of spiritual leadership.<br>-the creator of <i>St. Elmo&#x2019;s Fire,</i> who wasn&#x2019;t sure he could quit his successful Hollywood life for the deeper artistic life he had always wanted to pursue.<br>-the author himself. Po Bronson has worked as a bus-boy, cook, janitor, sports-medicine intern, bus-lift assembly-line technician, aerobics instructor, litigation consultant, greeting-card designer, bond salesman, political-newsletter editor, high school teacher, and book publisher. Since then, he has written three books: <b>Bombardiers</b>, <b>The First $20 Million Is Always the Hardest</b>, and <b>The Nudist on the Late Shift</b>. But none of those experiences compared to what he learned by writing this book.<br>&#x201c;We all have passions if we choose to see them,&#x201d; he writes. &#x201c;Most of us don&#x2019;t get epiphanies. We don&#x2019;t get clarity. Our purpose doesn&#x2019;t arrive neatly packaged as destiny. We only get a whisper. A blank, nonspecific urge. That&#x2019;s how it starts.&#x201d;<br><br>With humor, empathy, and insight, Po Bronson probes the depths of people who learned how to hear the whisper, who overcame fear and confusion to find a larger truth about their lives. A meditation, a journey, and a triumph of story-telling, <b>What Should I Do with My Life?</b> is a life-changing book by a writer who brilliantly tackles the big questions.</p><p>In <i>What Should I Do with My Life?</i> Po Bronson manages to create a career book that is a page-turner. His 50 vivid profiles of people searching for "their soft spot--their true calling" will engage readers because Bronson is asking himself the same question. He explores his premise, that "nothing is braver than people facing up to their own identity," as an anthropologist and autobiographer. He tackles thorny, nuanced issues about self-determination. Among them: paradoxes of money and meaning, authorship and destiny, brain candy and novelty versus soul food. Bronson&#x2019;s stories, limited to professional people and complete with photos, are gems. They include a Los Angeles lawyer who became a priest, a Harvard MBA catfish farmer turned biotech executive, and a Silicon Valley real estate agent who opened a leather crafts factory in Costa Rica.<p> Bronson is a gifted intuitive writer, the bestselling author of <i>The Nudist on the Late Shift</i>, whose thoughtful, vulnerable voice emerges as the book&#x2019;s greatest strength and challenge. He describes his subject&#x2019;s lives along with the ways they annoy, puzzle, and worry him. He frets about meddling with his questions, yet once, memorably and appropriately, he offers a talented man a top post in his publishing company. While this creates the juiciness of his portraits, it also can make Bronson the book&#x2019;s most memorable character and the only one whose story is not resolved. Even so, this remarkable career chronicle sets the gold standard for the worth of the examined life. <i>--Barbara Mackoff</i></p>Although all three of his books have been critically acclaimed bestsellers, author Po Bronson began work on <b>What Should I Do with My Life?</b> because he was asking himself that very question. For answers, he crossed the landscape of America to find people who have struggled to unearth their true calling&#x2014;people of all ages, classes, and professions who have found fulfillment: those who fought with the seduction of money, intensity, and novelty and overcame their allure; those who broke away from the chorus to learn the sound of their own voice.</p><h2>The New Jerusalem Bible</h2><p>Contains the complete text of the Regular Edition, with condensed notes and introductions. Easy-to-read two column format, with a Theological Glossary containing two hundred key words and concepts. Perfect for the casual reader.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>In 1956, scholars from L'Ecole Biblique in Jerusalem set their minds to translating the Scriptures from the original Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts, hoping they could preserve the most sacred Christian traditions and stories. By 1966, the first English-language <i>Jerusalem Bible</i> was published. Since then it has become a favored text for lay readers and scholars alike. The accessible language and richly recounted stories, poetry, and letters in this edition is consistent with previous versions. However, this latest version stands out because of its clear format--clean double columns with easy-to-read type and quick reference headings.<i>The New Jerusalem Bible: Standard Edition</i> will satisfy the great need for an authoritative version of "the greatest story ever told" in a package so attractive, user friendly, and affordable, this edition is destined to become a classic. Using the same translation that has been hailed as "truly magnificent" (Journal of Bible Literature), the Standard Edition has a completely redesigned interior, set in a two-column format for easy reading.

When he hears a violin playing for the first time, he longs to make beautiful music. At first, Mole can only make horrible screeching noises on the new violin he gets, but he practices and practices. Finally, his patience and dedication are rewarded. Mole creates a magical gift that unbeknownst to him has the power to erase hatred from the hearts of all who hear his music.<br><br></p><p><br>David McPhail is the author and illustrator of many books for children, including the popular "Pig Pig" series. He lives with his family in Newburyport, Massachusetts.<br><br>In this tender-hearted picture book, McPhail (Tinker and Tom and the Star Baby) goes undergroundAliterallyAto explore the restorative powers of music. Mole feels something is missing from his life, which consists of digging tunnels all day and kicking back in front of the TV in his subterranean home each evening. One night Mole watches a man playing the violin on television ("He made the most beautiful music Mole had ever heard") and resolves to obtain his own violin and learn to play it. His initial attempts with instrument in hand could hardly be called music, but with great determination and practice, Mole soon coaxes gorgeous sounds from the strings. As Mole wonders what effect his music might have on an audience, McPhail cleverly depicts the melodious notes floating up through the ground to appreciative listeners and transforming the world into a more peaceful place. The illustrations chart the aspiring musician's progress through the seasons, as the sapling above his rooftop flourishes on a steady diet of his euphonious tunes. The brief, simply phrased text brims with big ideas that may inspire many a young musician or artist. McPhail's delicate watercolor-and-ink paintings work seamlessly in tandem with the words to deliver a truly resonant message: that music can change the world.

It is also a school of thought popular because of its rejection of the supposedly universalizing categories of the Enlightenment. In this devastating critique, mounted on behalf of the radical Enlightenment tradition, Vivek Chibber offers the most comprehensive response yet to postcolonial theory. Focusing on the hugely popular Subaltern Studies project, Chibber shows that its foundational arguments are based on a series of analytical and historical misapprehensions. He demonstrates that it is possible to affirm a universalizing theory without succumbing to Eurocentrism or reductionism.<br><br><i>Postcolonial Theory and the Specter of Capital</i> promises to be a historical milestone in contemporary social theory.</p><p><b>Vivek Chibber </b> is Associate Professor of Sociology at New York University. He has contributed to, among others, the <i>Socialist Register</i>, <i>American Journal of Sociology</i>, <i>Boston Review</i> and <i>New Left Review</i>. His book <i>Locked in Place: State-Building and Late Industrialization in India</i> won the 2005 Barrington Moore Book Award and was one of <i>Choice</i>&#x2018;s Outstanding Academic Titles of 2004.&#x201c;With its focus on cultural identities and mixtures, postcolonial theory ignored the larger context of capitalist relations and thus limited its scope to Western academia where it excelled in the game of growing and profiting from the liberal guilt feeling. Chibber&#x2019;s book simply sets the record straight, bringing postcolonialism down from cultural heights to where it belongs, into the very heart of global capitalist processes. The book we were all waiting for, a burst of fresh air dispelling the stale aroma of pseudo-radical academic establishment.&#x201d;&#x2014;Slavoj i ek<br><br>&#x201c;In this scrupulous and perceptive analysis, Vivek Chibber successfully shows that the &#x2018;universalizing categories of Enlightenment thought&#x2019; emerge unscathed from the criticisms of postcolonial theorists. He shows further that&#x2014;perhaps ironically&#x2014;Subaltern Studies greatly underestimates the role of subaltern agency in bringing about the transformations that they attribute to the European bourgeoisie. Chibber&#x2019;s analysis also provides a very valuable account of the actual historical sociology of modern European development, of Indian peasant mobilization and activism, and much else. It is a very significant contribution.&#x201d;&#x2014;Noam Chomsky<br><br>&#x201c;In this outstanding work&#x2014;a model of clarity in its architecture and argumentation&#x2014;key theorists of the &#x2018;Subaltern&#x2019; and of postcoloniality have met their most formidable interlocutor and critic yet. Chibber&#x2019;s critique of postcolonial theory and the historical sociological studies associated with it is, at the same time, a vigorous and welcome defense of the enduring value of certain Enlightenment universals as an analytical framework to both understand and radically change the world we live in.&#x201d;&#x2014;Achin Vanaik<br><br>&#x201c;Vivek Chibber has written a stunning critique of postcolonial theory as represented by the Subaltern Studies school. While eschewing all polemics, he shows that their project is undermined by their paradoxical acceptance of an essentially liberal-Whig interpretation of the bourgeois revolutions and capitalist development in the West, which provides the foundation for their fundamental assertion of the <i>difference</i> of the East. Through a series of painstaking empirical and conceptual studies Chibber proceeds to overturn the central pillars of the Subalternists&#x2019; framework, while sustaining the credibility of Enlightenment theories. It is a bravura performance that cannot help but shake up our intellectual and political landscape.&#x201d;&#x2014;Robert Brenner<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Postcolonial Theory and the Specter of Capital</i> is a must-read book for students of comparative politics and social theory. Vivek Chibber presents a forceful challenge to the Subaltern Studies school and to postcolonial theory more broadly. Arguing with great clarity, Chibber raises fundamental objections to their ideas about capitalism, power, and agency, and presents an alternative account of these ideas. Most fundamentally, he rejects the fundamental division between &#x2018;East and West&#x2019; associated with postcolonial theory and defends the &#x2018;universalizing categories of Enlightenment thought.&#x2019; This is a major contribution that is bound to reshape debate on these important issues.&#x201d;&#x2014;Joshua Cohen<br><br>&#x201c;In this book, Vivek Chibber has carried out a thoroughgoing dissection of Subaltern Studies. Like a highly skilled anatomist, he lays bare the skeleton, the nervous system, the arteries and veins of this school ... In the process the reader is also exposed to the nitty-gritty of a materialist historiography.&#x201d;&#x2014;Amiya Kumar Bagchi</p><h2>The Lost Arts of Hearth and Home: The Happy Luddite&#39;s Guide to Domestic Self-Sufficiency</h2><p><i>The Lost Arts of Hearth and Home</i> is not about extreme, off-the-grid living. It&#x2019;s for city and suburban dwellers with day jobs: people who love to cook, love fresh natural ingredients, and old techniques for preservation; people who like doing things themselves with a needle and thread, garden hoe, or manual saw. <br><br>Ken Albala and Rosanna Nafziger Henderson spread the spirit of antiquated self-sufficiency throughout the household. They offer projects that are decidedly unplugged and a little daring, including: <br><br>* Home building projects like rooftop food dehydrators and wood-burning ovens <br>* Homemaking essentials, from sewing and quilting to rug braiding and soap making <br>* The wonders of grain: making croissants by hand, sprouting grains, and baking bread <br>* Adventures with meat: pickled pig&#x2019;s feet, homemade liverwurst, and celery-cured salami <br><br>Intended for industrious cooks and crafters who aren&#x2019;t afraid to roll up their sleeves, <i>The Lost Arts of Hearth and Home</i> will teach you the history and how-to on projects for every facet of your home, all without the electric toys that take away from the experience of making things by hand.</p><p>Albala and Henderson follow up their The Lost Art of Real Cooking with an utterly charming collection of recipes and how-tos for the 21st-century hipster homemaker. Like postmodern Elizabeth Davids, they augment their own recipes with obscure, intriguing ones from earlier centuries, such as Apicius's fourth-century Apricot Minutal, which stews up the fruit with spices and garum, an ancient fish sauce. The book consists mostly of recipes&#x2014;albeit for unusual, slow-food, and occasionally bizarre dishes such as injera (Ethiopian sourdough pancakes), liverwurst, thousand-year-old eggs ( among the scariest things I have ever tried at home ), kombucha, and butter sauce with ambergris (yes, the waxy glob that forms in the intestines of sperm whales, which they barf up )&#x2014;but, like a quirky updated 1896 Fannie Farmer cookbook, it also includes eccentric but usable household hints and instructions, from soap-making to pounding a ring out of an old silver quarter (using an expedited method invented by Henderson's father). A fun gift for any curious reader, the book is a must-have for makers and urban homesteaders. (Oct. 2)&#x201c;If Irma S.

The Village Blend will be doing the coffee and dessert for the wedding of Matteo Allegro (Clare&#39;s ex) and Breanne Summour.

At least that was the only fly until Clare and Matteo are walking back to the Blend with the girl hired for the bachelor party, when suddenly the girl drops to the ground -- dead. Once again, Clare Cosi is involved in a murder. This time Matteo begs for her help and even gives Det. Mike Quinn, Clare&#39;s boyfriend, some straight answers. Why was this young woman killed? Will Clare find enough clues to solve the case before the wedding? Will Matteo actually get married? Things are changing.

Cheryl Harness is the author of more than fifty books for children and has illustrated over thirty of them. Her previous books include Mary Walker Wears the Pants and Remember the Ladies. She grew up in Missouri and lives there today.Gr 2&#x2013;5&#x2014;Prolific American history writer Harness stitches together information about flags as symbols of group unity with an extensive selection of the regional and national standards that defined the United States in its infancy and beyond. The opening pages offer examples of historical emblems, ranging from the colors hoisted on a Phoenician merchant ship to the flags representing imperial powers in the Age of Exploration. Turning to the 18th century, Harness narrows the story's focus to the American Revolution, exploring a variety of designs that colonists displayed during the war. Her account of the conflict and the following War of 1812 highlights the impact of a variety of evocative symbols&#x2014;toppled statues, colored uniforms&#x2014;but flags dominate the majority of the detailed, almost textbooklike watercolor and colored pencil illustrations. A few awkward phrases land heavily in an otherwise sprightly text, but Harness does educators a service by mentioning&#x2014;but not validating&#x2014;a couple of popular, unsubstantiated flag-related legends she says inhabit a "cloud of history-mystery." Unfortunately, the book's design disrupts the narrative flow on several occasions, particularly a full spread of 10 annotated Revolutionary-era flags that appears in the middle of a section on the Continental Congress and feels like misplaced (though informative) back matter. For those who can overlook the clunky layout and occasional textual thuds, this title is an innovative take on the power and purpose of symbols, replete with early American history and charming details.&#x2014;Robbin E.

Carefully crafted from various translations, each promise faithfully expresses God&#x2019;s Word in heartfelt, personal prayer language. </p><p>The author&#x2019;s intent is that by confessing these promises aloud, God&#x2019;s Word will become so rooted in the believer&#x2019;s spirit that he or she will not be able to turn from the truth, no matter how strong the attacks from the enemy. </p><p>Every promise is thoroughly cross-referenced, and a topical index of Scripture references helps the reader seek the counsel of God&#x2019;s Word in a specific area of their life.</p></p><p>James R.

His Plainsmen series brims with colorful characters, fierce battles and compelling historical lore.</p><p>The Civil War was over, and a great westward march began. Settlers and soldiers poured out of the East along the Bozeman Trail, cutting deep into sacred Sioux hunting grounds. For Red Cloud and his warriors, there would be no choice but to fight for their ancestral rights.</p><p>Seen through the eyes of gruff Sergeant Seamus Donegan, here is the historically accurate tale of a tragic opening to the war between two great civilization: the Fetterman Massacre of 1866.</p></p><p><p><b>Terry C. Johnston</b> was born on the first day of 1947 on the plains of Kansas, and has lived all his life in the American West. His first novel, <i>Carry the Wind</i>, won the Medicine Pipe Bearer's Award from the Western Writers of America, and his subsequent books have appeared on bestseller lists throughout the country. He lives and writes in Big Sky country near Billings, Montana.</p>Johnston's (Titus Bass trilogy) historical novel focuses on the Indian Wars of the latter half of the 19th century. Hero Seamus Donegan is an outsider from Ireland who transcends unjust charges of cowardice to earn the respect and admiration of his comrades-in-arms as they struggle to establish a fort in hostile Sioux country. His heart as big as Montana, Donegan is the only likable character in this strangely schizophrenic chronicle, in which the author's allegiance switches confusingly between the white man and the red man. Readers will find Johnston's account narrow-minded, the action disjointed and badly paced. The self-righteous army officers lack vision; they are motivated only by the desire for personal advancement. The Indians are portrayed as bloodthirsty freaks who delight in mutilation and murder, rather than as a race of men and women battling to save their cultural identity. The author's preoccupation with gory details and his penchant for schmaltzy dialogue make this a queasy read indeed. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Devastation of Baal (1) (Space Marine Conquests)</h2><p>The Blood Angels Chapter and their successors mount a desperate defence of their home world of Baal&nbsp;from the predations of the tyranid hive fleet Leviathan.<br><br>After a brutal campaign in the Cryptus System fighting the alien tyranids, Lord Dante returns to Baal to marshal the entire Blood Angels Chapter and their Successors against Hive Fleet Leviathan.

Have you noticed&nbsp;that hospital bills are almost unintelligible, except&nbsp;for the absurdly high dollar amount? Why is it that&nbsp;technology in other industries drives prices down,&nbsp;but in health care it&#x2019;s the reverse? And why, in&nbsp;health care, is the customer so often treated as a&nbsp;mere bystander&#x2014;and an ignorant one at that?<br><br>The same American medical establishment&nbsp;that saves lives and performs wondrous miracles&nbsp;is also a $2.7 trillion industry in deep dysfunction.&nbsp;And now, with the Affordable Care Act&nbsp;(Obamacare), it is called on to extend full benefits&nbsp;to tens of millions of newly insured. You might&nbsp;think that this would leave us with a bleak choice&#x2014;&nbsp;either to devote more of our national budget to&nbsp;health care or to make do with less of it. But there&#x2019;s&nbsp;another path.<br><br>In this provocative book, Jonathan Bush,&nbsp;cofounder and CEO of athenahealth, calls for a&nbsp;revolution in health care to give customers more&nbsp;choices, freedom, power, and information, and&nbsp;at far lower prices. With humor and a tell-it-likeit-&nbsp;is style, he picks up insights and ideas from his&nbsp;days as an ambulance driver in New Orleans,&nbsp;an army medic, and an entrepreneur launching a&nbsp;birthing start-up in San Diego. In struggling to save&nbsp;that dying business, Bush&#x2019;s team created a software&nbsp;program that eventually became athenahealth, a&nbsp;cloud-based services company that handles electronic&nbsp;medical records, billing, and patient communications&nbsp;for more than fifty thousand medical&nbsp;providers nationwide.<br><br>Bush calls for disruption of the status quo&nbsp;through new business models, new payment models,&nbsp;and new technologies that give patients more&nbsp;control of their care and enhance the physicianpatient&nbsp;experience. He shows how this is already&nbsp;happening. From birthing centers in Florida to&nbsp;urgent care centers in West Virginia, upstarts are&nbsp;disrupting health care by focusing on efficiency,&nbsp;innovation, and customer service. Bush offers a&nbsp;vision and plan for change while bringing a breakthrough&nbsp;perspective to the debates surrounding&nbsp;Obamacare.<br><br>You&#x2019;ll learn how:<br><br> � Well-intended government regulations prop up&nbsp;overpriced incumbents and slow the pace of&nbsp;innovation.<br> � Focused, profit-driven disrupters are chipping&nbsp;away at the dominance of hospitals by offering&nbsp;routine procedures at lower cost.<br> � Scrappy digital start-ups are equipping providers&nbsp;and patients with new apps and technologies&nbsp;to access medical data and take control of care.<br> � Making informed choices about the care we&nbsp;receive and pay for will enable a more humane&nbsp;and satisfying health care system to emerge.<br><br> Bush&#x2019;s plan calls for Americans not only to demand&nbsp;more from providers but also to accept more responsibility&nbsp;for our health, to weigh risks and make hard&nbsp;choices&#x2014;in short, to take back control of an industry&nbsp;that is central to our lives and our economy.</p><p><b>JONATHAN BUSH&nbsp;</b>is the CEO and cofounder of&nbsp;athenahealth, one of the fastestgrowing&nbsp;technology companies&nbsp;in the country. The nephew and&nbsp;cousin of two U.S. presidents, he&nbsp;has worked in health care for two&nbsp;decades. He has an MBA from Harvard and lives&nbsp;in Cambridge, Massachusetts.<br><br><b>STEPHEN BAKER</b> is a former senior writer for <i>BusinessWeek</i> and author of <i>The Numerati</i> and <i>Final Jeopardy</i>."I loved this book. Jonathan Bush is a goggle-eyed radical foaming for revolution in the house of health care--with the crucial, page-turning difference that for years he's actually been delivering on it. His story alone is worth the price of admission. He's driven ambulances in New Orleans, remade child delivery in San Diego, and built an Internet company that is transforming the way people practice medicine. And along the way you'll learn more about the real world of how health care works than should be possible for a book this interesting. Jonathan Bush is a singular new voice in American health care." --Atul Gawande, surgeon, professor, and author of "The Checklist Manifesto" <br> "This is a compelling, entertaining story--an insider's perspective on American health care by someone who has been closely involved in its reshaping. Few people amass Jonathan Bush's kind of experience or articulate as clearly what lies ahead." --Abraham Verghese, physician and author of "Cutting for Stone" <br> "Jonathan Bush is not only a brilliant visionary but he walks the talk when it comes to tackling the dysfunctions of our health care system. Reading this book will help you understand why things are as broken as they are and inspire you to be part of the fix."<br> --Regina Herzlinger, Nancy R. McPherson Professor of Business Administration, Harvard Business School, and author of "Who<br> Killed Health Care? ""America's $2 Trillion Medical Problem--and the Consumer-Driven Cure"<br> "Health care has successfully resisted organizational innovation to the detriment of our health and our economy. In "Where Does It Hurt?" Jonathan Bush gives exciting accounts of current innovation, and irreverently imagines an attainable future in which a vibrant medical marketplace is driven by health entrepreneurs, of which he himself is a prime example. Patients, physicians and policy wonks alike would be well served to take the provocative and illuminating tour." --Jeffrey Flier, MD, deann</p><h2>Drawing: Animals in Colored Pencil: Learn to Draw with Colored Pencil Step by Step (How to Draw &amp; Paint)</h2><p><p>In this comprehensive, 32-page book, accomplished artist Debra Kauffman Yaun shares her artistic insights and techniques for creating strikingly realistic animal drawings in colored pencil.

Tolkien</h2><p>One of the most prolific letter writers of this century, Tolkien wrote to his publishers, to members of his family, to friends and to fans of his books, a mass of letters which often reveal the inner workings of his mind, and which record the history of composition of many of his stories. This selection represents, in Tolkien&#39;s own words, a highly detailed portrait of the man in his many aspects; storyteller, scholar, Catholic, parent of a large family and observer of the world around him. The letters include fresh information about Middle-earth and its inhabitants as well as analyses by Tolkien himself of the meanings of his stories. Finally, this book will entertain anyone who appreciates the art of letter-writing, of which Tolkien was a master.</p><p>Scholars and fans of the great mythologist will find a rich vein of information in Humphrey Carpenter's <i>The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien</i>. Tolkien was a prodigious letter writer all his life; the sheer mass of his correspondence would give pause to even the most stalwart archivist (one shudders to think what he would have done with e-mail). But with the able assistance of Tolkien's son Christopher and a healthy dose of determination, Carpenter manages find the cream of the crop--the letters that shed light on Tolkien's thoughts about his academic and literary work, as well as those that show his more private side, revealing a loving husband, a playful friend, and a doting father. The most fascinating letters are, of course, those in which he discusses Middle-Earth, and Carpenter offers plenty of those to choose from. Tolkien discussed the minutia of his legend--sometimes at great length--with friends, publishers, and even fans who wrote to him with questions. These letters offer significant insights into how he went about creating the peoples and languages of Middle-Earth.<p> </p><blockquote>I have long ceased to <i>invent</i> (though even patronizing or sneering critics on the side praise my 'inventions'): I wait till I seem to know what really happened. Or till it writes itself. Thus, though I knew for years that Frodo would run into a tree-adventure somewhere far down the Great River, I had no recollection of inventing Ents. I came at last to the point, and wrote the 'Treebeard' chapter without any recollection of any previous thought: just as it is now. And then I saw that, of course, it had not happened to Frodo at all.</blockquote><p> This new edition of letters has an extensive index, and Carpenter has included a brief blurb at the beginning of each letter to explain who the correspondent was and what was being discussed. Still, we strongly recommend buying the companion volume, <i>J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography</i>, in order to better understand the place these correspondents had in Tolkien's life and get a better context for the letters. <i>--Perry M.

Far too many families are struggling with the emotionally and physically draining responsibility of redefining their relationship with, and caring for, someone who not long ago was a vibrant member of society, yet may not know their own name today.</p> <p><i>A Dignified Life</i> helps combat the burnout and frustration that often accompany the task of caring for an Alzheimer's patient. Author David Troxel, an Alzheimer's expert and executive director of the California Central Coast Chapter of the Alzheimer's Association, maintains that at its simplest this approach is based on treating the person like a best friend and working from their strengths, not their weaknesses. He explains: "As family members, caregivers and professionals, we have to try to connect with them. People with this disease in some way need someone to be . . . attentive and empathetic--someone who really tries to walk a mile in their shoes."</p> <p><i>A Dignified Life</i> goes beyond the typical tips offered by most books and takes advantage of readers' instinctive desire to build friendships and taps into the intuitive aspect of caregiving that is part of our very nature. It provides a complete model for care built around creative and effective communication and meaningful activities and includes touching stories that demonstrate how the Best Friends method continues to improve the lives of both those who have Alzheimer's disease and those who care for them.</p></p><p>Virginia Bell, MSW, developed the Helping Hand Adult Day Center sponsored by the Greater Kentucky and Southern Indiana chapter of the Alzheimer&#39;s Association in Lexington, Kentucky. The award-winning facility was one of the first dementia-specific adult day programs established in this country and remains one of the best. She received her master&#39;s in social work and served on two Kentucky Governor&#39;s Task Forces studying Alzheimer&#39;s care and service delivery. A frequent and popular speaker on aging, Ms. Bell has been directly involved with the annual conference of Alzheimer&#39;s Disease International for more than a decade.<p><b>Chapter 4<br>A New Start<br>The Art of Friendship</b></p> <p><br>Alzheimer's disease changes us all. Because of the associated memory loss and confusion, your mother, father, sister, brother, husband, wife, or partner may no longer know you or understand his or her relationship to you. Many caregivers are confused, frustrated, sad, or even angry about these losses. Your mother may have always been your closest confidante and strongest supporter; now, she does not recognize you. A spouse whom you counted on for many years to balance the checkbook, pay bills, file the income taxes, or cook three meals a day is no longer able to do these things. As a result, your relationship with the person changes whether you like it or not.</p> <p>Adopting a Best Friends approach can help diminish this pain and loss and can have a powerful impact on the person with dementia. When you rethink, or recast, your relationships to individuals with dementia and become a Best Friend to them instead of just a caregiver, the person now feels you are on his or her side. In addition, friendship helps evoke some of the social graces or learned manners of the person with dementia. It helps put the person on his or her best behavior.</p> <p>Caregivers using the Best Friends approach have made the Helping Hand day program of the Greater Kentucky/Southern Indiana Alzheimer's Association one of the most admired adult day programs in the United States. Many individuals with dementia in Helping Hand have been considered difficult and challenging by their own family caregivers. Yet at Helping Hand, because the staff and volunteers are acting as friends, they thrive. Families can have similar success using the Best Friends approach at home.</p> <p>Rather than staying in a state of despair, caregivers can learn to work through the pain and focus on gaining maximum value from the present; caregiving is transformed from a terrible burden to a job that becomes meaningful and satisfying. The process changes from a series of failures to a series of successes. Recasting this relationship to become a Best Friend does not mean taking away love or loving the person with dementia any less. It simply means approaching the relationship differently.</p> <blockquote> <i>One caregiver told us that he had always had a troublesome relationship with his father-so bad, in fact, that he ran away from home at age 16. He now cares for his father full time and says they have never been closer. They take a daily walk together, have an evening scotch and soda, and watch the grandchildren play soccer. They have found that they now enjoy each other's company. Because the father has forgotten much of the past and is often unsure of his relationship with his son, the son has realized that he, too, must let go of past slights and injustices. "What's the point of me dwelling on it?" the caregiver asks. "What's past is past."</i></blockquote> <p>Like many caregivers, the son never dreamed he would be in the position of taking care of his father, a father whom he admits disliking for much of his life. However, this family's approach to Alzheimer's care has helped heal not only the son's relationship with his father, but also wounds he has carried inside himself.</p> <p>Being a Best Friend is not just about altruism. Caregivers who recast their relationships take advantage of the principles of friendship to gain new ideas for handling day-to-day care in a more natural, positive way; prevent problems before they happen; form a new relationship with a loved one based on getting the most out of every day; and replace the stress and strain of caregiving with satisfaction. Below are the key ingredients for success.</p> <p><b>What is a Best Friend?</b></p> <p>FRIENDS KNOW EACH OTHER'S<br>PERSONALITY AND HISTORY</p> <p>A Best Friend becomes the person's memory.<br>A Best Friend is sensitive to the person's traditions.<br>A Best Friend respects the person's personality, moods, and problem-solving style.<br></p> <p>FRIENDS do things together</p> <p>A Best Friend enjoys activities with the person with dementia.<br>A Best Friend involves the person in activities and chores.<br>A Best Friend initiates activities.<br>A Best Friend ties activities into the person's past skills and interests.<br>A Best Friend encourages the person to enjoy the simple things in life.<br>A Best Friend remembers to celebrate special occasions.<br></p> <p>FRIENDS COMMUNICATE<br></p> <p>A Best Friend listens skillfully.<br>A Best Friend fills in the blanks.<br>A Best Friend asks questions that are easily answered.<br>A Best Friend recognizes the importance of non-verbal communication.<br>A Best Friend gently encourages participation in conversations.<br></p> <p>FRIENDS BUILD SELF-ESTEEM<br></p> <p>A Best Friend gives compliments often.<br>A Best Friend carefully asks for advice or opinions.<br>A Best Friend always offers encouragement.<br>A Best Friend offers congratulations.<br></p> <p>FRIENDS LAUGH TOGETHER OFTEN<br></p> <p>A Best Friend tells jokes and funny stories.<br>A Best Friend takes advantage of spontaneous fun.<br>A Best Friend uses self-deprecating humor often.<br></p> <p>FRIENDS ARE EQUALS<br></p> <p>A Best Friend does not talk down to the person.<br>A Best Friend works to help the person "save face."<br>A Best Friend does not assume a supervisory role.<br>A Best Friend recognizes that learning is a two-way street.<br></p> <p>FRIENDS WORK AT THE RELATIONSHIP<br></p> <p>A Best Friend is not overly sensitive.<br>A Best Friend does more than half the work.<br>A Best Friend builds a trusting relationship.<br>A Best Friend shows affection often.<br></p> <p>Source: The Best Friends Approach to Alzheimer's Care.</p> <blockquote> <i>Phil and Karen Zwicke renewed their marriage vows after 10 years of marriage. Surrounded by friends and family, the couple enjoyed the afternoon including champagne and wedding cake. Phil, 52, has been open with others about his diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease; both of them are determined to keep him active and enjoying life as long as possible.</i></blockquote> <p><br><b>FRIENDS COMMUNICATE</b></p> <p><br>The best friendships often involve a lot of talking. Whether it is on the telephone or over the office water cooler, friends generally love to swap stories, gossip, share ideas, send e-mails and instant-messages to each other, and confide in one another. Friends are also there to listen to each other, in good and bad times.</p> <p><b>A Best Friend Listens</b></p> <p>In Alzheimer's care, it is important to try to be there for the person when he or she wants to talk about important feelings. Individuals with Alzheimer's disease should be given time to offer their feelings or ideas. Sometimes patience is rewarded with an insight.</p> <blockquote> <i>Maria Scorsone has spoken three languages in her lifetime: Italian as a child, Spanish when she lived in Argentina, and English after she moved to the United States. She now often mixes the three languages. Her in-home aides became her Best Friends by listening to Maria's words very carefully. When the aides cannot follow the exact words, they can usually still understand her by listening to the tone of her voice and watching her facial expression and other body language.</i></blockquote> <p><br><b>A Best Friend Fills in the Blanks</b></p> <p><br>People with Alzheimer's disease begin to lose the structure of their sentences and language. When you can provide clues and cues, communication can vastly improve. Sometimes even filling in the blanks by supplying one or two words keeps the dialogue going.</p> <blockquote> <br><i>Edna Edwards loves to converse but has major difficulty finding the right words. When Edna says "Those little ones, I miss them . . . at the school . . ." her Best Friend says "Picadome School?" Edna can continue, "Picadome, that's my school!"<br></i></blockquote> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Conversation can continue about early childhood days, her teaching, and her schoolchildren, all because her Best Friend brought up some familiar names of people, places, and things in Edna's life.</p> <p><br><b>A Best Friend Asks Questions that Are Easily Answered</b></p> <p>The person may become easily frustrated if asked questions to which he or she does not know the answer.</p> <blockquote> <i>When Evelyn Talbott, a retired librarian, returned from a vacation, she would have been frustrated if someone had asked her to recall, "Where did you go on vacation," or "What was the name of the beach?" Instead, a friend asked skillfully, "Did you and your husband, Bob, have a good time watching those big waves on the ocean?"</i> <p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote> <p>When her Best Friend provided some details within the question, it triggered memories and allowed Evelyn to share her joy from her vacation and participate in the conversation.</p> <p><b>A Best Friend Recognizes the Importance of Non-Verbal Communication</b></p> <p>Because verbal skills are diminished, body language becomes very important in Alzheimer's care. A Best Friend should greet the person warmly, smile broadly, and hold out a hand. The handshake still holds special meaning with older people who remember a time when everyone in polite company would shake hands. Almost always, the person will respond with a handshake. A mutual handshake is the beginning of a bond, a deep-rooted symbol that one is a friend, not a foe. Talking with your hands can also be effective. Gestures such as tapping the seat on a chair can help the person get the message to sit down.</p> <blockquote> <br><i>Because of Mary Burmaster's hearing loss, body language was especially effective for a day center volunteer relating to her. After making eye contact, the volunteer smiled and would say, "Mary, lunch is ready." The volunteer would then touch her gently on the shoulder, pat her hand, and guide her to the table.</i></blockquote> <p><br>A Best Friend's gentle touch spoke volumes.<br></p> <p><b>A Best Friend Gently Encourages Participation in Conversations</b></p> <p><br>It is important to include the person in conversations as much as possible. Broad, open-ended questions ("Tell me about . . ."; "What do you think about . . .") that touch on the person's life experience can be particularly effective.</p> <blockquote> <i>There is so much in Jim Holloway's life to talk about: fishing with his uncle, raising German shepherd dogs, collecting yo-yos, studying great artists and their works, enjoying classical music, teaching theology, visiting Pompeii, attending Yale University, working on old cars, being a medic on a troop ship during WWII, and much more. </i> <p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote> All of this stays tucked away until a Best Friend gently encourages conversation by saying, "Tell me about . . ." <p></p> <p><br></p> <p>�2002.

While much teaching on prayer addresses practical issues and is experience-orientated, Graeme Goldsworthy&#39;s conviction is that good practice comes from a foundation of good biblical understanding.Using a biblical-theological approach, he examines the principles that lie behind particular texts in Scripture, and maps out the &#39;progress&#39; of prayer from Genesis to Revelation. He explains the basis for prayer, its role in our fellowship with God, and what is involved in Christian prayer.Above all, his desire is to encourage Christians in their praying, through a better understanding of, and reflection on, the &#39;big story&#39; of the whole Bible.</p><p></p><h2>Finding Our Way Again: The Return of the Ancient Practices</h2><p><b> Shines a practical light on the spiritual disciplines that have been in use since the time of Abraham. </b><p>In a sense, every day of our lives is labor.

McLaren (MA, University of Maryland) is an author, speaker, activist and public theologian. After teaching college English, Brian pastored Cedar Ridge Community Church in the Baltimore-Washington, DC area. Brain has been active in networking and mentoring church planters and pastors for over 20 years. He is a popular conference speaker and a frequent guest lecturer for denominational and ecumenical leadership gatherings in the US and internationally.</p>Prolific author and pastor McLaren is a big-picture guy. One of the most influential thinkers in the emergent church movement, he likes to analyze and categorize. This book, which inaugurates a series about traditional spiritual practices, paves the way for future installments by elaborating the big-picture rationale for spiritual disciplines: they cleanse us, enlighten us and bring us closer to God. As the title signals, they will also help us find our way past the unsatisfactory alternatives of secularism, dangerous fundamentalism and mushy spirituality. The former English teacher has a gift for the pithy phrase that nails a concept: faithing our practices is seeing the sacred value of everyday activities, for example. McLaren fans will enjoy his usual breadth of vision, easy style of exposition and synthesis of big ideas.

We are the sole superpower with no potential challenger for a generation. We can reach any point on the globe with our cruise missiles and smart bombs and our culture penetrates every nook and cranny of the global village. Yet we are now the most hated country on earth, buried beneath a mountain of debt and morally bankrupt.<br><br><i>Where the Right Went Wrong</i> chronicles how the Bush administration and Beltway conservatives have abandoned their principles, and how a tiny cabal hijacked U. S. foreign policy, and may have ignited a "war of civilizations" with the Islamic world that will leave America's military mired down in Middle East wars for years to come.<br><br>At the same time, these Republicans have sacrificed the American worker on the altar of free trade and discarded the beliefs of Taft, Goldwater and Reagan to become a party of Big Government that sells its soul to the highest bidder.<br><br>A damning portrait of the present masters of the GOP, <i>Where the Right Went Wrong</i> calls to task the Bush administration for its abandonment of true conservatism including:<br><br>- The neo-conservative cabal-liberal wolves in conservative suits.<br>- Why the Iraq War has widened and imperiled the War on Terror.<br>- How current trade policy outsources American sovereignty, independence and industrial power.<br></p><p>Although the George W. Bush administration is famous for being "on message," delivering a consistent and polished political perspective no matter what, such consistency apparently does not extend to every member of the conservative universe. In <i>Where the Right Went Wrong</i>, veteran pundit and occasional presidential candidate Patrick Buchanan offers up scathing criticisms of Bush's policies, the arrogance and boorishness of which, he warns, could ultimately dramatically destabilize the United States' superpower status. The problem, in Buchanan's eyes, is the rejection of traditional Reagan-era conservatism by an administration under the sway of the so-called "neoconservatives," who favor a pre-emptive military strategy and big government and don't mind running up dangerously huge budget deficits to support it. The war in Iraq, fought without direct demonstrable threat, alienates America in the eyes of the rest of the world, says Buchanan, squandering the global goodwill earned after the 9/11 attacks and creating exponentially larger numbers of terrorists who will threaten the U.S. for generations to come. The zeal over free trade among elected officials, a feeling notably not shared by Buchanan, Ross Perot, and Ralph Nader, is costing America jobs, Buchanan theorizes, and leading to a de-industrialized service-sector-only economy, an end to American self-sufficiency in favor of a reliance on global corporations, and a looming economic crisis. Refreshingly, and unlike pundits of his day, Buchanan crafts his arguments by examining world history, offering detailed analogies to the Roman Empire, the Civil War, and pre-Soviet Russia among others. Conservatives alienated by the Bush administration will find an eloquent champion in Buchanan and even liberals, who may not have known there was a conservative argument against war in Iraq, stand to learn something from a right side of the aisle perspective so different from that found in the Bush White House. <i>--John Moe</i>Patrick J. Buchanan, America's leading populist conservative, was a senior advisor to three American presidents, ran twice for the Republican nomination in 1992 and 1996, and was the Reform Party's presidential candidate in 2000.

Throughout the 50s and 60s, he photographed this relatively prosperous black community, recording the daily lives of the men and women who built the schools, churches, and hospitals that served their segregated society. He photographed family gatherings, weddings, funerals, and events at the high school. He photographed nightclub musicians, itinerant entertainers, and a wide range of professionals at work. His mission had strong political overtones. But this rich archive of photographs would have been destroyed and forgotten had it not been for Shawn Wilson, a young filmmaker, whose search for his own family photographs led him to Anderson's studio. </p><p>The 95 photographs contained in this book are art objects, but they are also historical documents. In his accompanying essay, writer Clifton Taulbert guides us through them, recalling his own memories of Greenville. The book also contains an interview with the late photographer and an essay on the political climate at the time. Together, these materials create a window into a world that has been overlooked in the aftermath of the civil rights movement--a community of prosperous, optimistic black Southerners who considered themselves first-class Americans despite living in a deeply segregated world.</p></p><p>Clifton Taulbert is the author of eight books, including <i>Once Upon a Time When We Were Colored</i>. Raised in Glen Allan, Mississippi, just outside Greenville, Taulbert writes and lectures about life in the segregated South. He currently lives in Tulsa. Shawn Wilson is creating a documentary film on Greenville, where he was born. He lives in New York City. Henry Clay Anderson (1911-1998) studied photography on the G. I. Bill, and ran Anderson Photo Service. A lifelong activist for social change, he recorded every aspect of life in Greenville until his death in 1998."I received my first camera when I was about nine years old," Anderson writes in one of the five essays accompanying this collection of his work. "I tried to catch pictures of people, cats, trees, houses, whatever was interesting to me as a little boy." After studying photography on the GI Bill, Anderson opened a studio in Greenville, Mississippi, in 1948. This slim volume presents 130 or so straightforward but affecting photos of a conservative, respectable, and separate African-American world during the Jim Crow years. Anderson documents children in their Sunday best, a postman, a majorette, a white-frocked girl posing next to a birthday cake with six candles, teenaged bathing beauties parading in front of a crowd, a group shot of the Rabbit Foot Minstrels ("The Greatest Colored Show on Earth") and weddings and funerals. The pictures show a way of life that, for obvious reasons, will not inspire nostalgia, but which certainly had its share of dignity and beauty. And to young would-be photographers, Anderson advised: "Try to show not the picture only, but show the person who had the ambition. And if he's showing it, he shows himself." <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>French Symbolist Poetry, Bilingual edition</h2><p>Any attempt to define the Symbolist movement and its influence inevitably loses itself in a welter of detail. One can say that these late nineteenth-century French poets were revolting against fixed forms and inert molds; that they were attempting to express an inner ideal reality rather than the objective world; that they deliberately blurred sense impressions and sought correspondences where none had been observed before; that they have had a profound influence on contemporary avant-garde writing, noticeably in Hart Crane, Ezra Pound, and T.S. Eliot. But in the end one has not said a great deal.<br><br>Whether viewed as influence or in and for themselves, the Symbolist are a tantalizing group. Paralleling similar movements in art and music, their intensely personal poetry leans more heavily on oblique suggestions and evocation than on overt statement. It sets its perceptions, intuitive and nonrational, squarely against intellectual and scientific thinking&#x2014;and this with a music that is flexible, intrepid, and subtle, sometimes even dissonant and jazzy. But the poetry itself is the movements best definition.<br><br>Here in bilingual form, together with an introduction and illuminating notes, are some forty carefully selected poems of that movement. They range from the remote beginnings in Nerval and Bauldelaire, through the humor and irony of Corbi�re and Laforgue, to the technical brilliance of Val�ry, who died as recently as 1945. For those who wish an over-all view of the movement, this is a generous sampling. For those who wish to delve more deeply, there are available excellent and more extensive translations by C.F. MacIntyre of Bauldelaire, Verlaine, Corbi�re, Mallarm�, and Rilke and by Patricia Terry of Laforgue.</p><p><b>C.F. MacIntyre </b>(1890-1967) is well known for his translations of influential works by Baudelaire, Goethe, Rilke, Corbi�re, Verlaine, and Mallarm�.</p><h2>Fire in the Bones: William Tyndale--Martyr, Father of the English Bible</h2><p>The leading personalities of his century would draw upon all their resources to stop him, from the brilliant Sir Thomas Moore to King Henry VIII; from Charles V, ruler of half of Europe, to the Pope. Both church and state hunted him relentlessly-at a time when the church held power over both soul and body and could condemn the heretic to execution by fire. His crime? Translating the words of the Bible into the "vulgar" English tongue. <p>He was William Tyndale, and the story of his life, told in Fire in the Bones, reads like a novel, as exciting in its facts as any fiction could be. He knew the smugglers' secret marks and their intense, fraternal loyalty. He tasted the salt of shipwreck and knew the despair of lost manuscripts buried under the waves of the North Sea. Intrigue, safe houses, bribes, spies, covert conversations, last-minute flight, aliases, imprisonment, loneliness, all wove their spell into the riddles of his hidden world. He died at last as a martyr, but not before he had bequeathed to the world some of the most beloved and sacred phrases and terms in Holy Writ, including Atonement, still small voice, and Let there be Light. Readers everywhere will be captivated by his story.</p></p><p>S. Michael Wilcox is an instructor at the institute of religion at the University of Utah.

Revised and updated throughout, the second edition maintains the book&#39;s distinctive focus on happiness. Each chapter now features a list of suggested readings to point students and instructors towards further resources. Other changes to the second edition include a more fully developed account of Augustine&#39;s understanding of happiness, new discussions of how technology shapes relationships and happiness, and consideration of the relationship between the natural law and the virtues.</p><p>Paul J. Wadell is professor of religious studies at St. Norbert College. He specializes in Christian ethics and has taught in this field for more than twenty years.Wadell&#x2019;s new edition of Happiness and the Christian Moral Life: An Introduction to Christian Ethics, is a fresh, enticing, and engaging entr�e into Christian Moral Theology that will quickly &#x201c;Friend&#x201d; and win a &#x201c;Like&#x201d; from undergraduates. From Wadell&#x2019;s pen flows a rich fundamental moral theology that is a formative guide for virtuous Christian living. Once again Wadell demonstrates his skill as a masterful teacher and scholar by including important additions, clarifications, and explanations to the chapters of his original, dynamic, and compelling work. (Dawn M. Nothwehr, Catholic Theological Union)<br><br>Reading Paul Wadell on the Christian moral life is like sharing a conversation with a wise and faithful friend. Through his graceful engagement of Augustine, Aquinas, and a host of contemporary Christian thinkers, Wadell reminds us that the quest for true happiness requires virtue, friendship, and an awareness of the stories that bind us. This second edition of an already superb book is theologically rich and deeply human. One cannot read Wadell without about being challenged and inspired. (Darin H. Davis, director, Institute for Faith and Learning, Baylor University)<br><br>In this new edition, Paul Wadell has substantially improved what was already a very fine book. While maintaining an engaging and down to earth style throughout, Wadell ably leads readers toward a sophisticated Christian understanding of the relationship among freedom, happiness, and the cultivation of virtue. Theologically rich, yet accessible and clear, Happiness and the Christian Moral Life would serve very well as a foundational text for an introductory undergraduate course in Christian ethics. (Christopher P. Vogt, St. John&#x2019;s University)<br><br>Happiness and the Christian Moral Life provides an extensive and wonderfully engaging introduction to deep thinking about the moral life. I have never read an introduction to Christian ethics which more warmly invites readers into the profoundly interconnected consideration of virtue, friendship, narrative, and happiness, or which more richly deserves a second edition. The welcoming tone and high precision with which we are invited by Paul Wadell to think about the Christian moral life as "learning to be happy" is effective in its approach and transformative in the challenging questions it poses to the reader. This second edition takes Wadell's masterful ability to draw one into bone-deep reconsiderations of ethics through new connections between virtue and narrative, temporal happiness and eschatological fulfillment, communities of friendship and moral development, infused virtues and the natural law, and vocation and daily life. Sitting at the feet of this gentle, confessional, contemplative, and humorous voice for ten chapters is an aesthetic experience, yet always insightfully tied to the daily practice of Christian discipleship. (Carter Aikin, Blackburn College)<br><br>This is a marvelous book, helpful for scholars, students and pastoral workers alike. Wadell brings the richness of the Catholic moral tradition to bear on the contemporary scene with clarity, enthusiasm and grace. Happiness and the Christian Moral Life is not merely a work of information, but an invitation to formation, an opportunity to think and feel deeply about the moral life as the locus of deepening our friendship with God. (Lisa Fullam, Jesuit School of Theology of Santa Clara University)<br><br>Those of us who teach Christian Ethics are always looking for a new textbook that will cover the basics of our field. But if a student came to my office looking for a guide for the journey to the virtuous life, I would put a copy of Happiness and the Christian Moral Life: An Introduction to Christian Ethics in her hand, and I would know I had done her a real service. This is a book for the heart and mind yearning for the happiness that comes from becoming fully human. (Patrick T. McCormick, Gonzaga University, Spokane)<br><br>Paul Wadell's Happiness and the Christian Moral Life is the clearest and most accessible introduction to Virtue Ethics I know of. Wadell makes Augustine and Aquinas come to life in a beautiful, compelling way.

Now she is a famous talk show host. Her daughter Ruby is a struggling comedienne. The two haven&#x2019;t spoken in more than a decade. Then a scandal from Nora&#x2019;s past is exposed, and Ruby is offered a fortune to write a tell-all about her mother. Reluctantly, she returns to the family house on Summer Island, a home filled with frayed memories of joy and heartache. Confronting a past that includes a never-forgotten love, a sick best friend, and a mother who has harbored terrible family secrets, Ruby finally begins to understand the complex ties that bind a mother and daughter&#x2014;and the healing that comes with forgiveness.</p><p>Few authors dare to truly analyze the complex natures of mother-daughter relationships. In her novel <i>Summer Island</i>, author Kristin Hannah perfectly captures the bittersweet, inspiring, disappointing, tragic, and human aspects of such a relationship. Set in the tranquil, present-day San Juan Islands, <i>Summer Island</i> presents itself as a deep investigation of the ramifications of a mother's abandonment of her two daughters. Unlike many similar novels, this one delivers the goods.<p> When Nora Bridge left her husband and her two daughters 10 years ago, she took the only route she could see, and assumed she still had her daughters' love. Now, though she is distant from her own daughters, Nora is the hostess of a radio advice show, where she advises listeners that "family comes first." When a scandal breaks and Nora hits rock bottom, she finds she has to rely on the two people she has betrayed most deeply: her daughters, Ruby and Caroline.</p><p> As an aspiring and failing comedian, Ruby's life in Los Angeles has shrunk into a directionless morass. She says when she dismisses superstition, "As if she needed magic to tell her that she was stuck in the spin cycle of her life." Though neither she nor Caroline are inclined to help their mother, Ruby finally agrees when a magazine offers to pay her for a tell-all expos�.</p><p> With a masterful balance of cutting wit, realistic dialogue, and lyrical description, <i>Summer Island</i> is by far Hannah's greatest work. Mothers, daughters, and sisters are sure to mark the passages and lend this novel to each other. If this is the standard for future Hannah novels, her fan base is sure to grow.<i>--Nancy R.E.

But true happiness in her new home is as elusive as d swamp mist. Ruby must carefully avoid a venomous enemy: her stepmother, Daphne, who cringes and sneers at her backwater upbringing. And Ruby's every effort to befriend her twin sister, Gisselle -- especially since Gisselle's crippling accident -- is answered with bitterness and vicious backstabbing. <br> So idyllic Greenwood -- the exclusive girls' boarding school that her father has chosen for his daughters' senior year -- seems to promise some peace from the conniving Daphne, and maybe even a fresh start with Gisselle. But Ruby's kind isn't welcome at Greenwood, and the legendarily strict headmistress, Mrs. Ironwood, plots with her stepmother to make her life miserable. Meanwhile, Gisselle is on a mission to break every school rule, leaving Ruby to suffer the humiliating punishments. But Ruby doesn't lose hope -- until a terrible tragedy leaves her alone in a world that never really wanted her. Ruby will have to summon every last ounce of her Cajun strength to reclaim her home, her future, and the happiness she once knew....</p><p>One of the most popular authors of all time, V.C.

Despite the promises I made to him, I have been having nightmares about it. I've seen the brochures of the school, which is called Greenwood. It does took beautiful, consisting of a grand structure containing the classrooms, an auditorium, a gym, and even an indoor pool; as well as three dormitory buildings, each with sprawling willow and oak trees in front; its own lake filled with lavender hyacinths; beautiful wooded grounds of red oak and hickory; clay tennis courts and ballfields; in short, everything anyone could want. I'm sure it has far better facilities and opportunities than I would have at our public school in New Orleans.<br><br>But it is a school attended by only the wealthiest, upper-class young women from the finest Creole families in Louisiana. I'm not prejudiced against wealthy people who come from highly respectable backgrounds, but I know I'll be surrounded by dozens and dozens of girls who have been brought up the way Gisselle has. They will think like her, dress like her, act like her, and they will make me feel like an outsider.<br><br>My father has great confidence in me. He thinks I can overcome any obstacles and I would be more than a match for any and all snobby girls I might encounter. He's so confident in my artistic talent that he believes the school will immediately recognize it and want to see me develop and succeed so they can get credit for it. I know he's just trying to help me shake off my doubts and fears.<br><br>But no matter how I feel about going to this school, I guess it's the best thing I could do at the moment, for it will at least get me away from my stepmother, Daphne.<br><br>When you came to visit us and you asked me if things had gotten better, I told you yes, but I wasn't telling you the whole truth. The truth was, I had almost been put away and forgotten in the mental institution my poor Uncle Jean, my father's brother, is in. My stepmother had conspired with the administrator to have me committed. With the help of a very nice but deeply disturbed young man named Lyle, I escaped and returned home. I told my father what had occurred and he and Daphne had a horrible argument. After things settled down, he came to me with the proposal to send me and Gisselle to Greenwood, the private school. I saw how important it was to him that we get away from Daphne, and I saw how happy she was that we were leaving.<br><br>So I am being pulled in two directions. On the one hand I am very nervous about attending Greenwood, but on the other I am glad to get away from what has become a very dark and dreary home. I feel bad about leaving my father. He seems to have grown years older in just a few months. Strands of gray have popped up here and there in his chestnut hair, and he doesn't stand as straight nor move as energetically as he did when I first arrived. I feel almost as if I'm deserting him, but he wants Gisselle and me to attend this private school and I want to make him happy and ease his burdens and tensions.<br><br>Gisselle hasn't once stopped complaining and whining. She is constantly threatening not to go to Greenwood. She moans and groans about having to be in a wheelchair and has everyone in the house running this way and that getting her things and satisfying her every whim. Not once did I ever hear her say the automobile accident was her and Martin's fault because of their smoking pot. Instead, she wants to blame the unfair world. I know the real reason she complains about going to Greenwood is that she's afraid she won't get what she wants whenever she wants it. If she was spoiled before, it was nothing compared to the way she is now. It makes it hard for me to feel sorry for her.<br><br>I have told her everything I know about our backgrounds, although she still won't accept the fact that our mother was a Cajun woman. Of course, she readily accepts all I tell her about Grandpere Jack, how he took advantage of our mother's pregnancy to make a bargain with Grandpere Dumas to sell Gisselle to the Dumases. He didn't know our mother was pregnant with twins, and Grandmere Catherine kept that fact from him until the day we were born, refusing to sell me too. I told Gisselle she could have easily been the one left in the bayou and I could have been the one brought up in New Orleans. That possibility puts the shudders into her and gets her to stop complaining for a while; but nevertheless, she has a way of getting under my skin and making me wish I had never left the bayou.<br><br>Of course, I often think of the bayou and the beautiful days we had together when Grandmere Catherine was still alive and you and I didn't know the truth about ourselves. Whoever said ignorance is bliss was saying the truth, especially when it comes to you and me. I know it's been harder for you to face up to it. You, perhaps more than I, have had to live with lies and deceit, but if I've learned anything, it's that we must forgive and forget if we are to go on enjoying anything in this world.<br><br>Yes, I wish we weren't half brother and half sister, and yes, I would come running home to you and we would build our lives together in the bayou, which is where my heart really is; but this isn't the course Destiny has laid out for us. I want us to be forever friends as well as brother and sister, and now that Gisselle has met you, she wants the same. Every time I get a letter from you she insists on my reading it aloud, and whenever you make a reference to her or tell her hello, she brightens with interest. Although with Gisselle you can never tell if it's just a momentary whim.<br><br>I love your letters, but I can't help feeling a bit sad whenever I get them. I close my eyes and hear the symphony of cicadas or the owl calling. Sometimes I imagine I can actually smell Grandmere Catherine's cooking. Yesterday Nina made us a crawfish etouffee for lunch, just the way Grandmere Catherine used to make it, with a roux glazed with butter and sprinkled with chopped green onions. Of course, as soon as Gisselle heard it was a Cajun recipe, she hated it. Nina winked at me and we had a private laugh, for we both knew Gisselle had eaten it heartily before.<br><br>Anyway, I promise I will write to you as soon as we are settled in Greenwood and maybe shortly, if you are able, you will come to visit us. At least you will know where to write.<br><br>I'd like to hear about the bayou and the people there, especially Grandmere Catherine's old friends. Most of all I'd like to hear about you. I suppose a part of me wants to hear about Grandpere Jack too. Although it is hard for me to think of him and not think of the terrible things he has done. I imagine he's a pathetic old creature by now.<br><br>So many sad things have happened to us so soon in our lives. Maybe...maybe we've already had our share of hardships and misfortune and maybe the rest of our lives will be full of good and happy things. Am I a fool to think so?<br><br>I can just see you smiling at me with those darling blue eyes of yours twinkling.<br><br>It's a very warm night here tonight. The evening breeze carries the scent of the green bamboo, gardenias, and camellias up to me. It's one of those nights when every sound can be heard seemingly for miles and miles. Sitting by my window, I can hear the streetcar rattling along St. Charles Avenue, and somewhere in another house someone is playing a trumpet. It sounds so sad, and yet it sounds so beautiful.<br><br>Now there's a mourning dove on the upper galerie railing, moaning its sad cry. Grandmere Catherine used to say I must wish for something good for someone the first time I hear the dove at night and wish it quickly, otherwise the dove's sad note will bring hard luck to someone I love. It's a night for dreaming and for making wishes. I'll make one for you.<br><br>Go out and call to the marsh hawk for me. And then make a wish for me.<br><br>As always,<br><br>Love, Ruby<br><br><b>Chapter 1: First Day</b><br><br>The rap, rap, rapping of a woodpecker woke me out of a restless sleep. I had been awake for most of the night, tossing and turning with worry about what the next day would bring. Finally the weight of fatigue shut my eyes, and I felt myself falling into the world of twisted dreams, until once again I had a familiar nightmare. In it I was drifting in a pirogue through the swamp. The water was the color of dark tea. I had no pole; the current was taking me mysteriously along into the darkness draped with Spanish moss, ghostlike as it undulated in the slight breeze. Over the surface of the water, green snakes slithered, following my canoe. The luminous eyes of an owl peered at me with suspicion through the darkness as I drifted deeper and deeper into the swamp.<br><br>In this nightmare there was usually the sound of a baby crying. It was too young to form words, but the cry sounded very much like a call for "Mommy, Mommy." It drew me on, but usually I woke up from this terrible nightmare before I went much farther into the darkness. Last night, however, I passed my furthermost point and continued into the murky, black world.<br><br>The pirogue made a turn and moved a little faster until I could see the luminous bone-white outline of a skeleton pointing its long, thin forefinger ahead, urging me to look into the darkness, until finally I saw the baby all alone, left in a hammock on the front galerie of Grandpere Jack's shack.<br><br>The pirogue started to slow down and then, right before my eyes, Grandpere Jack's shack began to sink into the swamp. The baby's cries grew louder. I reached over the side of the pirogue to row myself along faster, but my hand became entangled in green snakes. The shack continued to sink.<br><br>"NO!" I screamed. Deeper and deeper into the murky, muddy water it sunk, until only the galerie and the baby in the hammock remained. She had a small face, the color of a pearl. I reached out as I drew closer, but just as I could finally take hold of the hammock, the galerie sunk too.<br><br>It was then that I heard the rapping of the woodpecker, and my eyes snapped open to see the morning sunlight seeping in around the curtains to light up the pearl-colored silk canopy above my dark pine queen-size bed. As if they were blooming, all the colors in the floral wallpaper brightened under the warm illumination as well. Even though I had barely slept, I was happy to wake up to so much sunshine, especially after my nightmare.<br><br>I sat up and scrubbed my face with my palms until I had wiped the Sandman's traces out of my eyes and cheeks, and then I took a deep breath and told myself to be strong and be ready and be hopeful. I turned toward the window when I heard the voices of the grounds staff as they fanned out to clip the hedges, weed the gardens, and sweep the banana leaves off the pool patio and tennis courts. My stepmother, Daphne, insisted that they always make the grounds and buildings look as if nothing had happened the night before, no matter how gusty the wind or hard the rain.<br><br>The night before I had chosen and laid out my clothing for traveling to our new school. Expecting my stepmother would scrutinize how I was dressed, I chose one of my longer skirts and matching blouses. Gisselle finally relented and permitted me to set out her things as well, although she went to sleep vowing never to get up. I could still hear her threats and vows echoing in my ears.<br><br>"I'd rather die in this bed," she whined, "then make this dreadful trip to Greenwood tomorrow. Whatever you choose for me will be what I will wear when I take my last breath. And it will be all your fault, too!" she declared, falling back histrionically in her bed.<br><br>No matter how long I might have lived with my twin sister, I never got used to how unlike we were despite our virtually duplicated faces and figures, eye and hair color. And it isn't only because of the differences in our upbringing, either. I am sure that even in our mother's womb we didn't get along.<br><br>"My fault? Why would it be my fault?"<br><br>She propped herself up on her elbows quickly.<br><br>"Because you've agreed to all this, and Daddy does whatever you agree to do. You should have argued and cried. You should have thrown a tantrum, You'd think you would know how to throw a tantrum by now. Haven't you learned anything from me since you ran away from the swamps?" she demanded.<br><br>Learn how to throw a tantrum? Learn how to be a spoiled brat is what she really meant, and that was one lesson I could do without, even though she thought she had been doing me a favor by teaching me to be more like her. I swallowed back my laughter, knowing it would just enrage her more.<br><br>"I'm doing what I think is best for everyone, Gisselle. I thought you understood. Daddy wants us to be away. He thinks it will make life easier here for Daphne and him and for us too. Especially after all that has happened!" I emphasized, my eyes as big as hers could be.<br><br>She sank back in her bed and pouted.<br><br>"I shouldn't have to do anything for anyone else. Not after what's happened to me. Everyone should be thinking of me first and my suffering," she moaned.<br><br>"It seems to me everyone does."<br><br>"Who does? Who?" she snapped, with sudden energy and strength. "Nina cooks what you like, not what I like. Daddy asks your opinions before he asks mine. Beau comes around to see you, not me! Why...why...even our half brother, Paul, writes only to you, never to me."<br><br>"He always sends his regards to you."<br><br>"But not a separate letter," she emphasized.<br><br>"You've never written one to him," I pointed out.<br><br>She considered this a moment. "Boys should write first."<br><br>"Boyfriends, maybe, but not a brother. With a brother, it doesn't matter who writes first."<br><br>"Then why doesn't he write to me?" she wailed.<br><br>"I'll tell him to," I promised.<br><br>"No you won't. If he won't do it on his own...then...he won't. I'll just lay here forever, left to stare at the ceiling as usual and wonder what everyone else is doing, what sort of fun they're having...you're having," she added sharply.<br><br>"You don't lay here wondering about anything, Gisselle," I said, finally unable to stave off a smile. "You go wherever you want, whenever you want. You merely have to snap your fingers and everyone jumps. Didn't Daddy buy the van just so you could be taken everywhere in your wheelchair?"<br><br>"I hate that van. And I hate being taken in the wheelchair. I look like something being delivered, like breads or...or...boxes of bananas. I won't go in it," she insisted.<br><br>Daddy had wanted to drive to Greenwood in Gisselle's van, but she vowed she wouldn't set foot in it. He wanted to use it because of all the things she had insisted on taking with her. She had had Wendy Williams, our maid, in her room for hours and hours packing everything, deliberately demanding the most insignificant things just to make it all that much more difficult. My pointing out to her that we had limited space in the dormitory and we had to wear uniforms didn't dissuade her.<br><br>"They'll make space for me. Daddy said they would do all that they could to accommodate me," she insisted. "And as for wearing uniforms...we'll see about that."<br><br>She wanted her stuffed animals -- each and every one -- her books and magazines, her photograph albums, almost her entire wardrobe, including all her shoes, and she even had Wendy pack every last thing from her vanity table!<br><br>"You'll be sorry when you come home for vacations," I warned her. "You won't have the things you want here, and then -- "<br><br>"And then I'll just send someone out to buy them for me," she replied smugly. Sud...</p><h2>A History of Iran: Empire of the Mind</h2><p>Although frequently vilified, Iran is a nation of great intellectual variety and depth, and one of the oldest continuing civilizations in the world. Its political impact has been tremendous, not only on its neighbors in the Middle East but also throughout the world. From the time of the prophet Zoroaster, to the powerful ancient Persian Empires, to the revolution of 1979, the hostage crisis, and the current standoff over Iran's nuclear ambitions, Michael Axworthy vividly narrates the nation's rich history. He explains clearly and carefully both the complex succession of dynasties that ruled ancient Iran and the surprising ethnic diversity of the modern country, held together by a common culture. With Iran again the focus of the world's attention, <i>A History of Iran</i> is an essential guide to understanding this volatile nation.</p><p><b>Michael Axworthy</b> teaches at the Institute of Arab and Islamic Studies at the University of Exeter (UK). The author of <i>The Sword of Persia</i>, Axworthy publishes widely in the field of Iranian history. He lives in Cornwall, England.The peoples of the Iranian plateau have a written history of at least 2,500 years. The Persian Empire extended from Egypt to northern India, and the influence of the Persian language, literature, and architectural styles is still evident across western and central Asia. Unfortunately, most Americans view Iran today through the prism of staged anti-American demonstrations and the rantings of their current president. Axworthy, Honorary Fellow at the Institute of Arab and Islamic Studies at the University of Exeter in England, has provided a valuable counterpoint to those distorted impressions. He has written a compact but still inclusive narrative account that conveys both the diversity and richness of the various empires and cultural forces that have shaped the Iranian people. He offers fascinating insights into the political developments in the Achaemenid, Parthian, and Sassanid&nbsp;empires, and his efforts to illustrate how Iranians adopted Islam while resisting the &#x201c;Arabization&#x201d; of their culture is provocative. This is an excellent examination of the forging of a people who are poised to, once again, play a prominent role in world affairs. --Jay Freeman</p><h2>The Christian soldier: An exposition of Ephesians 6:10 to 20</h2><p>The Christian Soldier: An Exposition of Ephesians, 6:10 to 20</p><p>D.

It was the planet's most elusive secret, the prize coveted above all others. Between 1856 and 1876, six larger-than-life men and one extraordinary woman accepted the challenge. Showing extreme courage and resilience, Richard Burton, John Hanning Speke, James Augustus Grant, Samuel Baker, Florence von Sass, David Livingstone, and Henry Morton Stanley risked their lives and reputations in the fierce competition. Award-winning author Tim Jeal deploys fascinating new research to provide a vivid tableau of the unmapped "Dark Continent," its jungle deprivations, and the courage&#x2014;as well as malicious tactics&#x2014;of the explorers.</p><p>On multiple forays launched into east and central Africa, the travelers passed through almost impenetrable terrain and suffered the ravages of flesh-eating ulcers, paralysis, malaria, deep spear wounds, and even death. They discovered Lakes Tanganyika and Victoria and became the first white people to encounter the kingdoms of Buganda and Bunyoro. Jeal weaves the story with authentic new detail and examines the tragic unintended legacy of the Nile search that still casts a long shadow over the people of Uganda and Sudan.</p></p><p>Praise for Tim Jeal&#x2019;s <i>Stanley</i>, winner of the 2007 National Book Critics Circle Award for Biography<br><br>"A magnificent new life. . . .

These experienced quilters, authors of many books on quilt making, noticed the lack of information on planning and designing the cable, fan, feather, and other techniques that so wonderfully complete and enhance any quilt. Over 76 color photos show traditional quilts, often made by the authors, along with samples of early quilts. Full-size figures can be copied or traced.

National ad/promo. Tour.</p><p>Deborah Scaling Kiley is an avid sailor who in her youth participated in an Outward Bound program that later helped her survive the wreck of the Trashman. She went on to graduate from the University of Texas in 1999 and routinely speaks and writes on survival. Kiley currently lives in Texas with her children Marka and John.The knockout story of Deborah Kiley's five days and nights on a raft in heavy seas during a storm. Aided by journalist Noonan, she spins a harrowing tale. In 1982, 24-year-old Kiley, who had already sailed the Whitbred and other famous sailboat endurance races, fell in with John Lippoth, captain of the Trashman, a heavy-handling, 58-foot yacht he was sailing from Maine to Florida. The Trashman set sail with Debbie and John; his girlfriend Meg Mooney; tall, muscular Brad Cavanaugh and his buddy Mark Adams, a Brit with pale blue malamute eyes and a stupefyingly evil tongue. Somewhere off North Carolina they hit 40-foot seas; 80-knot winds shredded the sails and the engine burned out. The description of this part of the storm is hair-raising, with the crew frantically trying to handle the wheel and the character of each member showing strong and clear. Then, while Debbie was below catching a few hours sleep, the ship went down--in two minutes. (Her account of the terrifying awakening in heaving seas gives shivers.) The five victims clung to a rubber raft and initially fought hypothermia by staying in the water, whose walloping waves were warmer than the air. Eventually, they boarded the raft, found that Meg had many deeply infected cuts and scrapes, and kept each other warm by gathering in a heap in urinous bilge (released urine gave their only heat). Sharks tried to sink the raft from beneath; John and Mark drank seawater, went mad, and cast themselves into the sea; Meg died of blood poisoning. After many ships failed to see them, a Russian freighter finally picked up Brad and Debbie. Short and adrenaline-charged, especially with those sharks. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

With a simple, glowing text by noted historian and Little House scholar William Anderson, and glorious paintings by Dan Andreasen, Pioneer Girl is a very special portrait of a writer whose classic books and poineer adventures have made her one of the most popular literary figures in America. This picture-book biography of Laura Ingalls Wilder tells the remarkable story of the pioneer girl who would one day immortalize her adventures in the beloved Little House books. Written in simple, glowing text by noted Little House scholar William Anderson, and illustrated with glorious paintings by artist Dan Andreasen, this wonderful first biography captures the very essence of the little girl called ?Half-pint,&#39; whose classic books and pioneer adventures have made her one of the most popular literary figures in America.</p><p>William Anderson has written many books of history, biography, and travel. As a teacher, he has often taught the books of Mark Twain, and he visited Twain's homesites while researching this book. He is also the author of the picture-book biography <i>Pioneer Girl: The Story of Laura Ingalls Wilder</i> and <i>Laura Ingalls Wilder: A Biography.</i> Mr. Anderson lives and writes in Michigan.Grade 2-4?An overview of Wilder's life accompanied by idealized illustrations that may blur the line between the facts and the fantasy presented by the TV series. Anderson touches on significant events: the places Laura settled with her family as a child and glimpses of everyday life; her marriage and adult life with Almanzo Wilder; and her work as an author. Andreasen's paintings, romantically rendered in warm tones, do provide period details, but often idealize the stark realities mentioned in the text. Readers old enough to be interested in Wilder will find this to be an adequate introduction but may find greater satisfaction in one of the numerous biographies that include some of the many photos of Laura and relics from her life, as well as a time line of her journeys. Her many fans will also appreciate Kathryn Lasky and Meribah Knight's Searching for Laura Ingalls (S &amp; S, 1993), in which young Meribah Knight travels with her family to places featured in Wilder's books.?Susan M.

I would if I was your age. Quicker than sitting with this scum." </p><p> "I'll be all right," said Cork, the albino cypher clerk, and looked anxiously at the older man in the driving seat beside him. "We'll just have to hurry slowly," he added in his most conciliatory tone. Cork was a cockney, bright as paint, and it worried him to see Meadowes all het up. "We'll just have to let it happen to us, won't we, Arthur?" </p><p> "I'd like to throw the whole bloody lot of them in the Rhine." </p><p> "You know you wouldn't really." </p><p> It was Saturday morning, nine o'clock. The road from Friesdorf to the Embassy was packed tight with protesting cars, the pavements lined with photographs of the Movement's leader, and the banners were stretched across the road like advertisements at a rally: "The West has deceived us; Germans can look East without shame." "End the Coca-Cola culture now!" At the very centre of the long column sat Cork and Meadowes, becalmed while the clamour of horns rose all round them in unceasing concert. Sometimes they sounded in series starting at the front and working slowly back, so that their roar passed overhead like an aeroplane sometimes in unison, dash dot dash, K for Karfeld our elected leader; and sometimes they just had a free for all, tuning for the symphony. </p><p> "What the hell do they want with it then? All the screaming? Bloody good haircut, that's what half of them need, a good hiding and back to school." </p><p> "It's the farmers," Cork said, "I told you, they're picketing the Bundestag." </p><p> "Farmers? This lot? They'd die if they got their feet wet, half of them. Kids. Look at that crowd there then. Disgusting, that's what I call it." </p><p> To their right, in a red Volkswagen, sat three students, two boys and a girl. The driver wore a leather jacket and very long hair, and he was gazing intently through his windscreen at the car in front, his slim palm poised over the steering wheel, waiting for the signal to blow his horn. His two companions, intertwined, were kissing deeply. </p><p> "They're the supporting cast," Cork said. "It's a lark for them. You know the students' slogan: 'Freedom's only real when you're fighting for it.' It's not so different from what's going on at home, is it? Hear what they did in Grosvenor Square last night?" Cork asked, attempting once again to shift the ground. "If that's education, I'll stick to ignorance." </p><p> But Meadowes would not be distracted. </p><p> "They ought to bring in the National Service," he declared, glaring at the Volkswagen. "That would sort them out." </p><p> "They've got it already. They've had it twenty years or more." Sensing that Meadowes was preparing to relent, Cork chose the subject most likely to encourage him. "Here, how did Myra's birthday party go, then? Good show was it? I'll bet she had a lovely time." </p><p> But for some reason the question only cast Meadowes into even deeper gloom, and after that Cork chose silence as the wiser course. He had tried everything, and to no effect. Meadowes was a decent, churchy sort of bloke, the kind they didn't make any more, and worth a good deal of anybody's time; but there was a limit even to Cork's filial devotion. He'd tried the new Rover which Meadowes had bought for his retirement, tax free and at a ten per cent discount. He'd admired its build, its comfort and its fittings until he was blue in the face, and all he'd got for his trouble was a grunt. He'd tried the Exiles Motoring Club, of which Meadowes was a keen supporter; he'd tried the Commonwealth Children's Sports which they hoped to run that afternoon in the Embassy gardens. And now he had even tried last night's big party, which they hadn't liked to attend because of Janet's baby being so near; and as far as Cork was concerned, that was the whole menu and Meadowes could lump it. Short of a holiday, Cork decided, short of a long, sunny holiday away from Karfeld and the Brussels negotiations, and away from his daughter Myra, Arthur Meadowes was heading for the bend. </p><p> "Here," said Cork trying one more throw, "Dutch Shell's up another bob." </p><p> "And Guest Keen are down three." </p><p> Cork had resolutely invested in non-British stock, but Meadowes preferred to pay the price of patriotism. </p><p> "They'll go up again after Brussels, don't you worry." </p><p> "Who are you kidding? The talks are as good as dead aren't they? I may not have your intelligence but I can read, you know." </p><p> Meadowes, as Cork was the very first to concede, had every excuse for melancholy, quite apart from his investments in British steel. He'd come with hardly a break from four years in Warsaw which was enough to make anyone jumpy. He was on his last posting and facing retirement in the autumn, and in Cork's experience they got worse, not better, the nearer the day came. Not to mention having a nervous wreck for a daughter: Myra Meadowes was on the road to recovery, true enough, but if one half of what they said of her was to be believed, she'd got a long way to go yet. </p><p> Add to that the responsibilities of Chancery Registrar -- of handling, that is, a political archive in the hottest crisis any of them could remember -- and you had more than your work cut out. Even Cork, tucked away in Cyphers, had felt the draught a bit, what with the extra traffic, and the extra hours, and Janet's baby coming on, and the do-this-by-yesterday that you got from most of Chancery; and his own experience, as he well knew, was nothing beside what old Arthur had had to cope with. It was the coming from all directions, Cork decided, that threw you these days. You never knew where it would happen next. One minute you'd be getting off a Reply Immediate on the Bremen riots, or tomorrow's jamboree in Hanover, the next they'd be coming back at you with the gold rush, or Brussels, or raising another few hundred millions in Frankfurt and Zurich; and if it was tough in Cyphers, it was tougher still for those who had to track down the files, enter up the loose papers, mark in the new entries and get them back into circulation again...which reminded him, for some reason, that he must telephone his accountant. If the Krupp labour front was going on like this, he might take a little look at Swedish steel, just an in-and-outer for the baby's bank account... </p><p> "Hullo," said Cork brightening. "Going to have a scrap, are we?" </p><p> Two policemen had stepped off the kerb to remonstrate with a large agricultural man in a Mercedes Diesel. First he lowered the window and shouted at them; now he opened the door and shouted at them again. Quite suddenly, the police withdrew. Cork yawned in disappointment. </p><p> Once upon a time, Cork remembered wistfully, panics came singly. You had a scream on the Berlin corridor, Russian helicopters teasing up the border, an up-and-downer with the Four Power Steering Committee in Washington. Or there was intrigue: suspected German diplomatic initiative in Moscow that had to be nipped in the bud, a suspected fiddle on the Rhodesian embargo, hushing up a Rhine Army riot in Minden. And that was that. You bolted your food, opened shop, and stayed till the job was done; and you went home a free man. That was that; that was what life was made of; that was Bonn. Whether you were a dip like de Lisle, or a non-dip behind the green baize door, the scene was the same; a bit of drama, a lot of hot air, then tickle up the stocks and shares a bit, back to boredom and roll on your next posting. </p><p> Until Karfeld. Cork gazed disconsolately at the posters. Until Karfeld came along. Nine months, he reflected -- the vast features were plump and lifeless, the expression one of flatulent sincerity -- nine months since Arthur Meadowes had come bustling through the connecting door from Registry with the news of the Kiel demonstrations, the surprise nomination, the student sit-in, and the little bit of violence they had gradually learnt to expect. Who caught it that time? Some Socialist counter-demonstrators. One beaten to death, one stoned...it used to shock them in the old days. They were green then. Christ, he thought, it might have been ten years ago; but Cork could date it almost to the hour. </p><p> Kiel was the morning the Embassy doctor announced that Janet was expecting. From that day on, nothing had ever been the same. </p><p> The horns broke wildly into song again; the convoy jerked forward and stopped abruptly, clanging and screeching all different notes. </p><p> "Any luck with those files then?" Cork enquired, his mind lighting upon the suspected cause of Meadowes' anxiety. </p><p> "No." </p><p> "Trolley hasn't turned up?" </p><p> "No, the trolley has not turned up." </p><p> Ball-bearings, Cork thought suddenly: some nice little Swedish outfit with a get-up-and-go approach, a firm capable of moving in fast...two hundred quid's worth and away we all go... </p><p> "Come on Arthur, don't let it get you down. It's not Warsaw you know: you're in Bonn now. Look: know how many cups they're shy of in the canteen, just on the last six weeks alone? Not broken, mind, just lost: twenty-four." </p><p> Meadowes was unimpressed. </p><p> "Now who wants to pinch an Embassy cup? No one. People are absent-minded. They're <i>involved.</i> It's the crisis, see. It's happening everywhere. It's the same with files." </p><p> "Cups aren't secret, that's the difference." </p><p> "Nor's file trolleys," Cork pleaded, "if it comes to that. Nor's the two-bar electric fire from the conference room which Admin are doing their nut about. Nor's the long-carriage typewriter from the Pool, nor -- listen Arthur, <i>you</i> can't be blamed, not with so much going on; how can you? You know what dips are when they get to drafting telegrams. Look at de Lisle, look at Gaveston: dreamers. I'm not saying they aren't geniuses but they don't know where they are half the time, their heads are in the clouds. You can't be blamed for that." </p><p> "I <i>can</i> be blamed. I'm responsible." </p><p> "All right, torture yourself," Cork snapped, his last patience gone. "Anyway it's Bradfield's responsibility, not yours. He's Head of Chancery; he's responsible for security." </p><p> With this parting comment, Cork once more fell to surveying the unprep...</p></p><h2>Princess of Desire</h2><p>Japanese photographer and visual artist Ken-ichi Murata (Japanese Princess) creates highly detailed photographic stagings which evocatively depict nude models as though they were characters in an erotic fairytale. His enchanting models blithely shed their clothing and reveal their gorgeous nude bodies. What Murata strives to illustrate with these young girls is the image of the hime: an ancient Japanese word which can denote both a feeling of awe and a yearning for women. The conventional meaning of the word hime is noble princess. His second photobook is a virtuosic and fantastic journey into erotic dream worlds. Lots of explicit spread-legged nudity, a fair amount of bondage and kink, a fair number of photos of women peeing.

And as Agatha soon learns, Mr. John is as skilled at repairing her coiffure as he is at romancing her heart. But the charming Mr. John isn't all he appears to be. According to gossip around the salon and the village, some of his former clients seem to be afraid of him. Could Mr. John really be a ruthless blackmailer? When a murderer strikes at the busy salon, Agatha must discover the truth and the killer's identity before it's too late.<br></p><p><i>"She was a stocky middle-aged woman with good legs, a round face and small bearlike eyes which looked suspiciously out at the world.

Beaton's smartly updated Miss Marple, who does most of her amateur sleuthing amidst the glowing stone villages of England's Cotswold district. Cozy without being the least bit cute, Beaton's books about this tough little Raisin cookie are well-made and smoothly oiled entertainment machines, working unexpected changes on familiar turf.</p><p> It is indeed her prideful hair that leads Agatha onto the trail of murder in her eighth adventure, when a charming hairdresser called Mr. John repairs her disastrous home dye job, then makes what appear to be romantic overtures.

Lirael has never felt like a true daughter of the Clayr. Abandoned by her mother and ignorant of her father&#39;s identity, Lirael resembles no one else in her large, extended family living in the Clayr&#39;s Glacier. She doesn&#39;t even have the Sight - the ability to See into the present and possible futures - that is the very birthright of the Clayr. Nonetheless, it is Lirael in whose hands the fate of the Old Kingdom lies. She must undertake a desperate mission under the growing shadow of an ancient evil - one that opposes the Royal Family, blocks the Sight of the Clayr, and threatens to break the very boundary between Life and Death itself. With only her faithful companion, the Disreputable Dog, to help her, Lirael must find the courage to seek her own hidden destiny. Garth Nix draws readers deeper into the magical landscape of the Old Kingdom and weaves a spellbinding tale of discovery, destiny and danger.</p><p>Fourteen years have passed since the necromancer Sabriel bound the Greater Dead Adept Kerrigor beyond the Ninth Gate and helped restore King Touchstone to the Old Kingdom throne. Now she rules at his side as Abhorsen, the sole necromancer of the Old Kingdom, keeping the people safe from the dark power of Free Magic. But this is not just Sabriel's tale. It is also the story of Hedge, a mysterious necromancer who is digging up a monstrous evil that could utterly destroy the Old Kingdom. And it is the story of Prince Sameth, Touchstone and Sabriel's only son, who would rather fight an entire army of Dead than disappoint his beloved parents. And Sam's friend Nick, who has unknowingly loosed Free Magic into the Old Kingdom, blissfully ignorant of its complete malevolence. But mostly, this is the tale of Lirael, the only daughter of the future-seeing Clayr who does not possess the Sight. Burying the pain of her Sightlessness in the Clayr's great library, Third Assistant Librarian Lirael's insatiable curiosity will soon lead her to an unbelievable destiny that may even be connected with that of the great Sabriel herself. <p> Garth Nix's stunning sequel to <i>Sabriel</i>, full of Mages, Moggets, and even a Disreputable Dog, is on par with the equally superb works of Philip Pullman and William Nicholson. And fantasy lovers of all ages will be thrilled to discover that <i>Lirael</i> ends with more questions than answers, which will mean a third dip into Nix's beguiling Charter Magic. Both exhilarating and mesmerizing, this fine novel is pure enchantment.

The product of a twenty-five year, multi-million pound effort to identify the most prevalent human talents, the StrengthsFinder programme introduces thirty-four talents or &#34;themes&#34; and reveals how they can best be translated into personal and career success. Each copy of the CD contains a unique pin number that gives the reader access to the StrengthsFinder Profile, a Web-based interview that analyses people&#39;s instinctive reactions and immediately presents them with their five most dominant strengths. Once listeners know which of the thirty-four talent themes dominates their personality, they can make practical applications at three levels: as an individual, as a manager and within an organisation. Readers learn what kind of environments will allow them to flourish; how managers can better cultivate their employers&#39; talents; and how almost all organisations inhibit the talents of their people and need to change.</p><p>Effectively managing personnel--as well as one's own behavior--is an extraordinarily complex task that, not surprisingly, has been the subject of countless books touting what each claims is the true path to success. That said, Marcus Buckingham and Donald O. Clifton's <i>Now, Discover Your Strengths</i> does indeed propose a unique approach: focusing on enhancing people's strengths rather than eliminating their weaknesses. Following up on the coauthors' popular previous book, <i>First, Break All the Rules</i>, it fully describes 34 positive personality themes the two have formulated (such as Achiever, Developer, Learner, and Maximizer) and explains how to build a "strengths-based organization" by capitalizing on the fact that such traits are already present among those within it.<p> Most original and potentially most revealing, however, is a Web-based interactive component that allows readers to complete a questionnaire developed by the Gallup Organization and instantly discover their own top-five inborn talents. This device provides a personalized window into the authors' management philosophy which, coupled with subsequent advice, places their suggestions into the kind of practical context that's missing from most similar tomes. "You can't lead a strengths revolution if you don't know how to find, name and develop your own," write Buckingham and Clifton. Their book encourages such introspection while providing knowledgeable guidance for applying its lessons. --<i>Howard Rothman</i></p>Marcus Buckingham spent seventeen years at the Gallup Organization, where he conducted research into the world's best leaders, managers, and workplaces.

The area was renowned for distilling whiskey, legal and otherwise, and after exposure to the war in Vietnam, many locals&nbsp;turned to the cultivation of marijuana and thrived. The characters Higdon reveals to us are not notably different from Protestant thugs of the hills, but not one has ever snitched.

Perhaps you have in mind the beautiful lords and ladies of the round table. Or maybe you think of the Quest for the Holy Grail. Perhaps you think of the early Celtic legends about him. Whatever you associate with the stories that surround this legendary king, you are sure to agree that these myths have fascinated Westerners for up to 1500 years. <br> <br>The Tarot has been popular for only half that time, but it, too, has caught the fascination of people in the West. Now you can see how easily these two spiritual paths can be combined thanks to Anna-Marie Ferguson's <i>A Keeper of Words. <br> <br></i>Although designed to accompany and enhance her <i>Legend</i> Tarot deck (available separately), this book is also a great way to get to the core of both the Arthurian myths and legends and the Tarot. The book is based upon Ferguson's amazing seventy-eight watercolor <i>Legend</i> illustrations (all are reproduced here in black-and-white). Each of the Tarot cards is associated with an event or person in the Arthurian legends. By combining the two you will have a new perspective on the Tarot and a deeper understanding of the mythic symbolism of the tales of King Arthur. <br> <br>For example, the book associates the Major Arcana card the Hierophant with Taliesin. The image shows Taliesin introducing children to "his lady," the harp. You will learn that Taliesin encourages questions from all and fosters their creative, artistic talents. Thus, the meaning of the card is "A person with experience he or she is willing to share. An authority. A kind and generous mentor who nurtures spiritual awareness." Reversed it means "Rigid thinking with no room for growth." <br> <br>The description and symbolism for this and all seventy-eight images, as well as the meanings of the images in a Tarot reading, go into far more detail. In this way your readings become deeper, more intuitive and multilayered. <br> <br>For anyone interested in the Tarot (especially the <i>Legend</i> Tarot), or King Arthur, this book is a must. <br> <br></p><p>I think it is important to keep learning. But some subjects seem to have a finite amount you can learn about them. For example, the Tarot. If you learn the meanings of the cards and lots of spreads and you may think you've got it. <br> <br>Humans are creative and continue to find inspiring, new ways of looking at the Tarot. In this way a person's understanding of the cards can continue to expand. <br> <br>In <i>A Keeper of Words,</i> Anna-Marie Ferguson actually brings something old to the cards: the Arthurian legends. She created images for each of the seventy-eight Tarot cards (you can get her deck that is the focus of this book, <i>Legend: The Arthurian Tarot,</i> separately). Each image is a scene or character from the Arthurian myths. These images (reproduced in the book in black-and-white) can add to your knowledge of the ancient legends as they deepen your interpretive understandings of the Tarot. <br> <br>The book has everything you need: An introduction to Tarot cards; an introduction to the Arthurian legends; and instructions on how to read the cards with three spreads and a sample reading. Then it examines each and every one of the <i>Legend</i> deck images. <br> <br>For each one you will discover the meaning of the card (both upright and reversed) as well as a description of her watercolor painting and the meaning of the symbolism. By learning from the symbolism of the card you will find that your interpretation of the Tarot becomes even better and your appreciation and understanding of the Arthurian legends will grow. <br> <br>If you have an interest in either the Tarot or legends of Camelot and Arthur, this book is a must. Linked together in this book, they can increase not just your knowledge, but your wisdom in both areas. Your Tarot readings will be better, Your understanding of Arthurian symbols and archetypes will be more instinctive, and you will find guidance in the wisdom of these two great spiritual systems.

Suza Scalora collects the evidence in <i>The Fairies: Photographic Evidence of the Existence of Another World</i>, presenting color-drenched photographs of fairies captured by her stealthy lens. After seeing her first fairy, "a small green creature with delicate yellow wings that sparkled in the sun," she went on a mission: "I set out across the world to catalog and photograph every fairy I could find." Indeed, each ethereal being is carefully classified by its common name, other names, sighting date and location, and history. For fellow fairy fanciers, peak sighting seasons and lures are also provided (pencils attract Eugenie, the Emerald Forest Fairy, while black volcanic sand is required for Ophelia, the Pearl-White Fairy). Whether you're a believer or not, the prints are truly beautiful, and Scalora's passionate, detailed descriptions will at least make you want to consider the possibility that these diminutive creatures exist. Fairy aficionados will also want to check out Brian Froud's much acclaimed <i>Faeries</i> and its lovely sequel, <i>Good Faeries, Bad Faeries</i>. <i>--Brangien Davis</i>Suza Scalora has been fascinated by fairy lore for as long as she can remember. She began her research while working in New York City as a commercial photographer. When the opportunity presented itself, Ms. Scalora set out to discover and capture images of the fairy world. In what became a yearlong expedition of epic -- and at times perilous -- proportions, she was finally able to prove something that she has known all along: Fairies are real.</p><h2>At Home with Wedgwood: The Art of the Table</h2><p>There&#x2019;s only one Wedgwood, but there are limitless expressions of Wedgwood style.<br><i><br>At Home with Wedgwood</i> showcases 250 years of the company&#x2019;s innovations&#x2013;in all its manifestations&#x2013;and the imaginative ways today&#x2019;s collectors draw inspiration from the past and integrate Wedgwood pieces into their lives.

Theorists such as Herbert Spencer and William Graham Sumner adopted the idea of the struggle for existence as justification for the evils as well as the benefits of laissez-faire modern industrial society. Others such as William James and John Dewey argued that human planning was needed to direct social development and improve upon the natural order. Hofstadter's classic study of the ramifications of Darwinism is a major analysis of the social philosophies that animated intellectual movements of the Gilded Age and the Progressive Era.</p><p>Tracing the impact of Darwin on thinkers throughout the gilded Age and the Progressive era, &#39;Social Darwinism&#39; shows how a politically neutral scientific theory has been adapted with skillful rhetoric to contradictory purposes.Richard Hofstadter (1916-1970) was a Dewitt Clinton Professor of American History at Columbia University and author of many books.

Best here is the title novella--a magistrate's sorrowful insistence on conscience during the Fascist period, refusing to sentence a man to death: a meditation on capital punishment, moral traduction, and cultural imprecision (``to see European history in the guise of the Russians who would like to be Germans, Germans who'd like to be French, French who would like to be half-German and half-Italian while still remaining French, Spaniards who would settle for being English if they can't be Romans, and Italians who would like to be anything and everything except Italian''). Equally interesting, and somewhat fleshier, is ``Death and the Knight''--a terminally ill police investigator's world-weary slog through lies and much more obvious (though denied) truths. Sciascia (Sicilian Uncles, etc.) here is a compiler of Stendhalian asides and ruminations rather than a narrative-maker. But these are fine literary artifacts for all that: hung upon the police-procedural framework, the cloth is rich and dark if none to form-fitting. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Fennell. 1981 trade paperback published by Sculpt-Nouveau.</p><p></p><h2>Transformed By the Light: The Powerful Effect of Near-Death Experiences on People&#39;s Lives</h2><p>Closer to the Light - The New York Times bestseller by the distinguished team of Dr. Melvin Morse and science writer Paul Perry - broke new ground in our spiritual and scientific understanding of near-death experiences. Acclaimed as a "masterpiece of understanding," Closer to the Light studied children who had been resuscitated and returned from death only to tell miraculous stories about what they experienced as they died.<br>Transformed by the Light breaks new ground again, this time by examining the changes that take place in those who have had near-death experiences. Based on the results of the largest study ever done of people who have had near-death experiences, Transformed by the Light proves that those who return from the brink of death are profoundly changed for the better - spiritually and physically - for the rest of their lives, and that these documented changes provide deeper peace and understanding for all who come in contact with them.<br>The Transformations Study focused on more than four hundred subjects from all walks of life- housewives, secretaries, lawyers, doctors, salespeople - all of whom had near-death experiences as children. Each subject was given a battery of psychological tests and interviewed at length. Medical records were examined and sometimes even friends were interviewed. The results were astounding:<br>People who have near-death experiences are healthier and have fewer psychosomatic complaints (like headaches and stomachaches).<br>Psychologically they are happier, have stronger family ties, more "zest" for living, and a greatly diminished fear of death.<br>A significant increase in psychic abilities was found in almost all of those who had near-death experiences. Many of them were able to tell when certain events would take place, day after day. Some could "see" events happening to friends or even strangers in vivid detail hours before they happened.<br>The Transformations Study provided the scientific data to propose a new theory of brain/mind interaction. It links physics, medicine, neuroscience, and the human spirit in a profound new understanding of life and death. Inspirational, scientific, and deeply compassionate, Transformed by the Light continues Morse and Perry's remarkable explorations.</p><p>ul enough to fascinate even the most ardent skeptic and raise goosebumps on the arms of the believer...Profound."<br>TOPEKA CAPITAL-JOURNAL<br>Written by bestselling authors Dr. Melvin Morse and Paul Perry, TRANSFORMED BY THE LIGHT proves that those who return from the brink of death are profoundly changed for the better--spiritually and physically--for the rest of their lives, and that these documented changes provide deeper peace and understanding for all who come in contact with them.

We can't survive without them but at the same time it's in our relationships that we so easily come unravelled. There are certain relationships that seem to just do us in. Either we feel like we lose ourselves or we feel burnt out from unsuccessful efforts to make things right for another. In our relationships we can experience the very best of ourselves and the very worst. Most psychological approaches to building resilience focus on the individual -- the individual mind, emotions and experiences.</p><p>The message of <i>Growing Yourself Up</i>, however, is that you can't separate understanding the individual from understanding relationships; they go hand in hand.</p><p>All of life's relationships are integral to increasing self-awareness and growing maturity -- and it's not necessarily the comfortable relationships that promote personal growth.</p><p>Drawing from Bowen family systems theory, this book takes you on a journey through each stage of life to see the predictable patterns of relationships and to show how to use this knowledge to make purposeful adjustments in yourself. The result, though certainly not a quick fix, is a sturdier self, sturdier relationships and a refreshing new way of viewing life's challenges and opportunities.</p></p><p>Jenny Brown is the founder and director of the Family Systems Institute in Sydney, Australia, where she has a counselling practice and trains mental health professionals and organisations.

Hamilton's legions of eager fans will be pleased to see <i>Cerulean Sins</i>), the eleventh novel in her Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter series, which is set on an alternate Earth where magic works and vampires and werewolves are real. When a sinister stranger tries to hire the magically potent Anita Blake to raise the dead, she finds herself embroiled in the search for a vicious, supernatural serial killer, and also in the clandestine international politics of the vampires. And as she becomes more deeply enmeshed in cruel plots and counterplots, her tangled personal life only becomes more demanding, more wrenching, and more erotically fraught.<p> With ten previous books in the Anita Blake series, <i>Cerulean Sins</i> is not the place to start. Though author Hamilton artfully reveals the backstory in small doses, the numerous returning characters and the complex history will overwhelm most newcomers (and even the most devoted fans may find that the backfilling slows the pace). Also, the characters frequently stand around talking and psychoanalyzing one another, which makes for static stretches unlikely to hold a new reader's attention.

Now, some of these don&#x2019;t occur naturally&#x2014;the man-made synthetic compounds&#x2014;and we&#x2019;ll cover them too. However, many ingredients for our Stuff exist inside the earth or on its surface. They only need to be harvested or extracted... Only!</b> <br> <br>Once we start examining them, we soon find that each key ingredient requires a lot of <i>other</i> ingredients just to get it out of the earth, processed, and ready for use. In the case of paper, for example, we don&#x2019;t just need trees. We need metals to make the chainsaws and logging machines; trucks, trains, and even ships to cart the logs to processing plants; and oil to run all those machines and the plants themselves. We need water (a lot of it) for making the paper pulp. We usually need a chemical like bleach (no!) or hydrogen peroxide (better) to get a desirably light shade of paper. All in all, making one ton of paper requires the use of 98 tons of various other resources.1 And believe me when I say that&#x2019;s a pretty simple example. That&#x2019;s why we have to look at the whole materials economy, and often a map of the world, to get a clear picture of the ingredients that go into any one product on store shelves these days.<br> <br>There are lots of ways to think about the various resources that come from the earth. For simplicity&#x2019;s sake I&#x2019;ll use just three categories: trees, rocks, and water.<br> <br> <b> <b>Trees</b> </b> <br> <br>As I said in the introduction, having grown up in Seattle, a green city in an even greener state, I love trees. Half of the land area in Washington State is covered in forests,2 and I visited them every chance I had. Over the course of my childhood I watched in dismay as more and more forests gave way to roads and malls and houses.<br> <br>As I grew older, I learned that there are more than sentimental reasons to worry about the fate of our trees. Trees create oxygen, which&#x2014;may I remind us&#x2014;we need to breathe. That alone would seem sufficient motivation for us to keep them intact. As the lungs of the planet, forests work around the clock to remove carbon dioxide from the air (a process called carbon sequestration) and give us oxygen in return. These days scientists concerned about climate change research all sorts of elaborate, expensive, man-made schemes to sequester carbon from the atmosphere in hopes of moderating climate change. Seems like a waste if you ask me. We already have a natural system that not only sequesters carbon but also provides the exact kind of air we need to breathe: our trees. And their services are free! It doesn&#x2019;t get much better than that.<br> <br>And there&#x2019;s more&#x2014;forests provide other vital services. They collect and filter our fresh water, maintaining the planet&#x2019;s overall hydrologic cycle and moderating floods and droughts. They maintain soil health by keeping the nutrient-rich topsoil in place. What are we <i>thinking</i>, destroying these obvious allies?<br> <br>To name just one more reason that it&#x2019;s a terrible idea to cut down forests: one-quarter of all our prescription drugs are derived from forests&#x2014;rainforests in particular.3 Curare, an anesthetic and muscle relaxant used in surgery4; ipecac, for treating dysentery5; and quinine, for malaria6 are just a few examples. Not long ago, western chemists were turned on to a plant native to the tropical forests of Madagascar, the rosy periwinkle, after learning that the island&#x2019;s healers used it to treat diabetes. It turns out the pink-flowering plant has anticancer properties, and is now used to make the medicines vincristine and vinblastine. The former is used to treat Hodgkin&#x2019;s disease, and the latter has proven to be a total wonder drug for those suffering from childhood leukemia, who now have a 95 percent chance of survival, up from their previous slim 10 percent chance before the plant was discovered.7<br> <br>(Unfortunately, even though sales of the two drugs are in the hundreds of millions of dollars per year, almost none of this money winds up in the hands of the people in Madagascar, which is one of the poorest countries in the world.8 This will be a recurring theme.)<br> <br>It&#x2019;s nuts to be wiping out forests anywhere on the globe, but it&#x2019;s especially crazy to be clearing the tropical rainforests because they contain such richness of biodiversity. Generally, the closer forests are to the equator, the greater the diversity of trees and other species they contain. A twenty-five-acre plot of rainforest in Borneo, for instance, can contain more than seven hundred species of trees, which is equal to the total number of tree species in all of North America.9<br> <br>And the plants and other life we&#x2019;ve discovered so far are just the beginning; most scientists estimate that only 1 percent of the species that exist in the rainforest (and only there) have been identified and examined for their beneficial properties.10<br> <br>If the loss wasn&#x2019;t so tragic, it would be ironic that these invaluable repositories of not-yet-discovered useful chemicals are being cleared in the name of &#x201c;progress&#x201d; and &#x201c;development.&#x201d; It seems to me a far wiser development strategy would be protecting these forests that will potentially heal our ills (as well as provide the air we breathe, clean our waters, and moderate our climate).<br> <br>When I was kid savoring my time camping out in the forest, I hadn&#x2019;t ever heard of carbon sequestration, hydrologic cycles, or plant-derived pharmaceuticals. Instead, one big reason I loved forests was the many animals that lived in them. Forests provide homes for about two-thirds of the species on earth11&#x2014;from koala bears, monkeys, and leopards to butterflies, lizards, parrots, you name it. Cutting down these homes, especially in areas of rich biodiversity like tropical rainforests, leads to the extinction of as many as one hundred species a day.12 One hundred species per day? For some perspective, think of all the dogs you&#x2019;ve ever seen; worldwide, they make up fewer than ten species (genus <i>Canis</i>).13 And there&#x2019;s only <i>one</i> species of human! Losing one hundred species a day is a big deal. Those species could contain miracle medicines or could play some vital irreplaceable role in the food chain. Wiping them out is like throwing out our lottery ticket before we have even checked if we had the winning number.<br> <br>Imagine for a minute that some other species (maybe <i>Periplaneta fuliginosa,</i> aka the smokybrown cockroach) had control over the planet and was eradicating one hundred species per day to satisfy their appetites. What would we say about them? We might think their actions were a little unfair. What would we <i>do</i> about them? Lead an insurrection? Of course, we might not have a chance&#x2014;from one day to the next we could just be extinguished, along with ninety-nine other lesser species.<br> <br>And trees don&#x2019;t just house wildlife&#x2014;around the world about 300 million <i>people</i> live in forests, while about 60 million indigenous people are almost wholly dependent on them.14 Forests are the main source of life for more than a billion people living in extreme poverty.15 Forests provide the &#x201c;four F&#x2019;s&#x201d; essential for survival: food, fodder, fiber, and fuel. From healthy forests, indigenous, tribal, or other forest-dwelling communities gather or hunt for food, feed livestock, obtain materials to build homes, and collect firewood for cooking and heat.<br> <br>As I was growing up in Seattle, my primary relationship with forests was based on a fifth F: fun. I relied on the forests for hiking, camping, birding, and cross-country skiing, not for building materials. If I needed a snack, I&#x2019;d head for the fridge, not the forest. Even after studying the issue, my understanding of the connection between forests and immediate survival was academic, not experiential. It wasn&#x2019;t until I went overseas that I realized how directly forests sustain life in other countries.<br> <br>While traveling in the once lush Haitian countryside, I met families who had lost their homes after forests were cleared. After the destruction of the roots that held the soil in place and moderated water flows following a heavy rain, mudslides took the homes of those families. No forests, no flood control. In India, I saw women walking miles a day to collect branches to feed cows, patch roofs, or cook rice. No forests, no fodder, fiber, or fuel. Forests are essential to life. The values of all these kinds of services dwarf the price of timber from a felled forest.<br> <br>In fact, economists are working to calculate the monetary benefits that forests produce. In October 2008, the European Union undertook a study to put a dollar value on the forest services that we&#x2019;re losing through deforestation each year. This study, published in <i>The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversit</i>y report, warns that the cost to the global economy from the loss of forests is far greater than the economic losses incurred up to that point in the banking crisis that garnered so much media attention and government action that year. Further, the report points out, the losses from deforestation aren&#x2019;t a one-time fiasco, but continuous, year after year.16 By evaluating the many services that forests perform and figuring out how much it would cost for humans to adapt to their losses and provide these services themselves, the study calculated the cost of forest loss at between $2 trillion and $5 trillion, or about 7 percent of global GDP <i>each year.</i>17 Now, if that doesn&#x2019;t merit a bailout on both economic and environmental grounds, I am not sure what does.<br> <br>Despite the implications, even though they provide frames for our houses and our lifesaving medicines, even though they filter our water and create the air we breathe, we&#x2019;re still cutting down forests at breakneck speed. Globally, we&#x2019;ve been losing more than 7 million hectares a year, or 20,000 hectares&#x2014;almost 50,000 acres&#x2014;a day.18 This is equivalent to an area twice the size of Paris each day, or about thirty-three football fields&#x2019; worth every minute.19 According to Rainforest Action Network, fifty thousand species of trees go extinct every year.20<br> <br>Rates of forest loss are especially high in Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean, and much of Asia. According to reports, the exceptions are China and India, where large investments in forest plantations skew the data to hide the ongoing rates of loss of natural forests.21 However, industrial timber plantations are very different from real forests. The goal of a plantation is to produce wood products, with little or no regard to the many other services, resources, and habitat that real forests provide. To this end, they are generally intensely managed, evenly spaced, monoculture fields of imported species with the highest wood yields. Such plantations simply don&#x2019;t hold a candle to the real thing in terms of biological diversity, resistance to disease, or provision of the many other nontimber forest products that people and animals depend on for survival. Tree plantations can generally only sustain 10 percent of the species that lived in the forests that preceded them22 and are best described as &#x201c;green deserts.&#x201d; They also provide relatively few jobs, increase the use of pesticides, and negatively impact local water cycles.23<br> <br>So scientists, climatologists, and economists&#x2014;not to mention all the animals and other people&#x2014;concur that we need real nonplantation forests. Yet we continue to cut those down&#x2014;not only in the biodiversity hot spots in the tropics, but also right here at home, in the temperate forests of the Pacific Northwest.<br> <br>I got to see this firsthand during the summer of 1980, when I spent more time in the forests than out of them. It was the summer after tenth grade, and I signed up to work for the Youth Conservation Corps, or YCC. The YCC was a federal program, established a decade earlier to get kids out of the city, in some cases off of the street, and into the woods for a summer of service and learning. We worked hard, learned about natural systems, and earned a modest salary as well as a sense of purpose. It was my first experience with what my colleague Van Jones would later call &#x201c;green-collar jobs.&#x201d;<br> <br>My YCC site was in the North Cascades National Park in Washington State, a breathtakingly gorgeous region with terrain ranging from alpine peaks and glaciers dotted with crystal blue lakes that literally sparkled in the sun to lowland forests, from mossy dark green water-soaked temperate rainforests to dry ponderosa pine ecosystems. Even for a forest connoisseur like me, this was truly a special place.<br> <br>Jack Kerouac, who spent a summer there about twenty years before I did, does justice to the area in <i>The Dharma Bums</i>: &#x201c;It was a river wonderland, the emptiness of the golden eternity, odors of moss and bark and twigs and mud, all ululating mysterious visionstuff before my eyes, tranquil and everlasting nonetheless, the hillhairing trees, the dancing sunlight... The pine boughs looked satisfied washing in the waters. The top trees shrouded in gray fog looked content. The jiggling sunshine leaves of Northwest breeze seemed bred to rejoice. The upper snows on the horizon, the trackless, seemed cradled and warm. Everything was everlastingly loose and responsive, it was all everywhere beyond the truth, beyond emptyspace blue.&#x201d;24<br> <br>Amidst this incredible natural beauty, my new YCC friends and I spent our days clearing fallen tree limbs from hiking trails, burying campfire remnants from careless campers, tending to the local salmon hatchery, and learning about the forest ecosystem from college students whose expertise and worldliness awed me. The program worked&#x2014;at least for me it did. I entered that summer loving forests because of the way I felt in them: secure, grounded, humbled in the presence of something that seemed divine. I ended the summer realizing that our rivers, the fish, and the planet as we know it depended on forests. I left with a solid commitment to protect them.<br> <br>That summer, I saw my first clear-cuts up close. &#x201c;Clear-cutting&#x201d; is the term for aggressive logging that removes all the trees in an area. All the roots, all the wildflowers, all the life. The ground is shaved clean like the head of a prison inmate, so nothing but scattered stumps and drying brown brush remains. I&#x2019;ve heard clear-cut sites compared to ravaged, pockmarked bomb sites like Baghdad. That&#x2019;s an apt description. Previously, I&#x2019;d see them from the windows of a plane or just driving past, getting away as fast as we could. But that summer, we hiked in them to see how different they felt from a forest. We sampled water in the creeks that ran below them, to see the changes in temperature, oxygen, and aquatic life. It was shocking to me to see how far the damage spread, far beyond the scorched boundaries of the cut.<br> <br>In contrast to forests, which act like giant sponges that hold water in their leaves and trunks and among their roots, regulating its flow into streams and rivers, clear-cut areas don&#x2019;t hold soil and don&#x2019;t absorb water. During heavy rains, water just runs off clear-cut hills, causing mudslides, flooding, and erosion. Waterlogged earth comes down in landslides, clogging waterways and burying communities. Downstream, the water and mud destroys property and sometimes injures or kills people. In some cases, millions of dollars of government money is required to repair the damage. In other places, the people just bear the cost themselves, sometimes losing everything they have. And of course the damage impacts the entire delicate web of life dependent on forests: the fungi that grow in the roots of trees feed small mammals, which feed birds like owls and hawks, and so on.<br> <br>For me, that summer in the North Cascades gave new meaning to something that early wilderness advocat...</p><h2>The Last Chronicle of Barset</h2><p>Trollope, Anthony, Last Chronicle of Barset</p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M.

Mrs. Scattergood-the landlady at the Seven Sleepers Inn-swore it was rats, but Maddy Smith knew better. Only goblins could have burrowed into the brick-lined floor, and besides, as far as she knew, rats didn't drink ale.<br><br>But she also knew that in the village of Malbry-as in the whole of the Strond Valley-certain things were never discussed, and that included anything curious, uncanny, or unnatural in any way. To be imaginative was considered almost as bad as giving oneself airs, and even dreams were hated and feared, for it was through dreams (or so the Good Book said) that the Seer-folk had crossed over from Chaos, and it was in Dream that the power of the Faerie remained, awaiting its chance to re-enter the world.<br><br>And so the folk of Malbry made every effort never to dream. They slept on boards instead of mattresses, avoided heavy evening meals, and as for telling bedtime tales-well. The children of Malbry were far more likely to hear about the martyrdom of St. Sepulchre or the latest Cleansings from World's End than tales of magic or of World Below. Which is not to say that magic didn't happen. In fact, over the past fourteen years the village of Malbry had witnessed more magic in one way or another than anyplace in the Middle Worlds.<br><br>That was Maddy's fault, of course. Maddy Smith was a dreamer, a teller of tales, and worse, and as such, she was used to being blamed for anything irregular that happened in the village. If a bottle of beer fell off a shelf, if the cat got into the creamery, if Adam Scattergood threw a stone at a stray dog and hit a window instead-ten to one Maddy would get the blame.<br><br>And if she protested, folk would say that she'd always had a troublesome nature, that their ill luck had begun the day she was born, and that no good would ever come of a child with a ruinmark-that rusty sign on the Smith girl's hand- which some oldsters called the Witch's Ruin and which no amount of scrubbing would remove.<br>It was either that or blame the goblins-otherwise known as Good Folk or Faerie-who this summer had upped their antics from raiding cellars and stealing sheep (or occasionally painting them blue) to playing the dirtiest kind of practical jokes, like leaving horse dung on the church steps, or putting soda in the communion wine to make it fizz, or turning the vinegar to piss in all the jars of pickled onions in Joe Grocer's store.<br><br>And since hardly anyone dared to mention them, or even acknowledge that they existed at all, Maddy was left to deal with the vermin from under the Hill alone and in her own way.<br><br>No one asked her how she did it. No one watched the Smith girl at work. And no one ever called her witch-except for Adam Scattergood, her employer's son, a fine boy in some ways but prone to foul language when the mood took him.<br><br>Besides, they said, why speak the word? That ruinmark surely spoke for itself.<br><br>Now Maddy considered the rust-colored mark. It looked like a letter or sigil of some kind, and sometimes it shone faintly in the dark or burned as if something hot had pressed there. It was burning now, she saw. It often did when the Good Folk were near, as if something inside her were restless and itched to be set free.<br>That summer, it had itched more often than ever, as the goblins swarmed in unheard-of numbers, and banishing them was one way of putting that itch to rest. Her other skills remained unused and, for the most part, untried, and though sometimes that was hard to bear-like having to pretend you're not hungry when your favorite meal is on the table-Maddy understood why it had to be so.<br><br>Cantrips and runecharms were bad enough. But glamours, true glamours, were perilous business, and if rumor of these were to reach World's End, where the servants of the Order worked day and night in study of the Word . . .<br><br>For Maddy's deepest secret-known only to her closest friend, the man folk knew as One-Eye-was that she enjoyed working magic, however shameful that might be. More than that, she thought she might be good at it too and, like anyone with a talent, longed to make use of it and to show it off to other people.<br>But that was impossible. At best it counted as giving herself airs.<br>And at worst? Folk had been Cleansed for less.<br><br>Maddy turned her attention to the cellar floor and the wide-mouthed burrow that disfigured it. It was a goblin burrow, all right, bigger and rather messier than a foxhole and still bearing the marks of clawed, thick-soled feet where the spilled earth had been kicked over. Rubble and bricks had been piled in a corner, roughly concealed beneath a stack of empty kegs. Maddy thought, with some amusement, that it must have been a lively-and somewhat drunken-party.<br><br>Filling in the burrow would be easy, she thought. The tricky thing, as always, was to ensure it stayed that way. or, the Protector, had been enough to secure the church doors, but goblins had been known to be very persistent where ale was concerned, and she knew that in this case, a single charm would not keep them out for long.<br><br>All right, then.

Past books focused on the apparent good guys--"black" magicians who use order-magic (cooling, healing, strengthening) and constantly oppose the White Order of chaos wizards whose talent is fire and dissolution. Young hero Cerryl has a natural bent for chaos, and for him the Whites offer the only game in town. Painfully, he learns about balance: order-magic can be deviously used for destruction, chaos can cleanse and anyway requires order-control if it's not to destroy the user. This moves interestingly away from simplistic "black is good, white is bad" magical color-coding ... but although Cerryl is a decent, ethical white wizard, the Order remains unpleasantly tyrannical--for example, an instant life sentence of slave labor for the equivalent of expired license plates. The magic training is interesting if repetitive (apprentices practice firebolts by zapping blockages in the public sewers), but Modesitt's real story lies in waiting for Cerryl to become a full mage of the Order and perhaps confront its injustices in the massive sequel, <i>Colors of Chaos</i>. <i>--David Langford, Amazon.co.uk</i>"Return to the disciplined and uncompromising world of fantasy.

He formulates many policies, pursues various particular aims: but all policies and each single aim are framed within the scope of that strategy. </p><p> The Society of Jesus was established by the papacy in 1540 as a very special "fighting unit" at the total and exclusive disposal of the Roman Pope -- whoever he might be. From their beginnings, the Jesuits were conceived in a military mode. Soldiers of Christ, they were given only two purposes: to propagate the religious doctrine and the moral law of the Roman Catholic Church as proposed and taught by the Roman Pope, and to defend the rights and prerogatives of that same Roman Pope. Purely spiritual and supernatural purposes. And specifically Roman Catholic. Surprisingly enough, given this mandate of the Society, papal strategy itself has become the wedge of separation between Jesuits and papacy -- indeed, the very arena where the lethal battle between the two is being fought. </p><p> Plus XII, Pope from 1939 to 1958, had found himself in a new world dominated by two rival superpowers, one of which -- the USSR -- he held in anathema. His postwar policy was one of intractable opposition to Soviet Marxism, and of support for "Western" civilization, centered in Europe and protected by the United States. </p><p> John XXIII, Pope from 1958 to 1963, was convinced that an "open windows, open fields" policy would induce others -- including the Soviets -- to refashion their own attitudes and policies. Pope John lowered as many barriers between the Church and the world -- including the Soviet Union -- as he could in his short, action-packed pontificate. He even went so far as to guarantee the USSR immunity from attacks by the Church, a stunning reversal of papal attitudes. </p><p> It was a huge gamble. And it could only work if an adequate amount of goodwill reigned among his opposite numbers. </p><p> The gamble failed. The great poignancy was that when he died, Pope John, peasant-realist that he was, knew that his openness had been seen as weakness, and had been taken advantage of by men of much smaller spirit. </p><p> Pope Paul VI, 1963-1978, blind to the deficiencies of John's policy, further refined it. The Holy See became nothing less than a plaintiff at the bar of Soviet power, pleading on diplomatic grounds for a hearing; instituting cautious conversations; practicing the week-kneed art of concessionary approaches -- and even stooping to mean-spirited deception and betrayal of the admittedly difficult Primate of Hungary, Cardinal Mindszenty, in order to please the Soviets and their castrated Hungarian surrogate, Janos Kadar. </p><p> In all of this, Paul VI, personally the gentlest of all modern Popes, unwittingly compromised his papal authority. His grand strategy for his Church was taken over and prostituted by others, reducing him to an impotence that scarred his last disease-ridden years until his death on August 6, 1978. </p><p> Still, it was Paul VI who, very late in the day of his papacy, realized that the original dual purpose of the Society of Jesus had been changed. Under his pontificate, an extensive critical dossier about the Society was compiled. It is enough for the moment to say of that dossier that its contents were damning. It was a portrait, in effect, of a Jesuit Order that, like a weathervane atop a roof, had been turned by a different wind. For Jesuits, the papacy no longer held primacy of position. The corporate aim of the Society was now to place itself and the Church at the disposal of a radical and purely sociopolitical change in the world, without reference to -- indeed, in defiance of -- papal strategy, policies, and aims. </p><p> In 1973, Paul VI, alarmed more than ever by the way the Society's members were behaving, tried to stop the onrush of events. He met with the head of the Order, Jesuit Father General Pedro Arrupe, several times. More than a few of those interviews between the two men were stormy. More than once, Paul wanted Arrupe to resign. One way or the other, Arrupe survived all papal attacks. Paul VI did insist that Arrupe convey to his Jesuits "Our demand that the Jesuits remain loyal to the Pope." Arrupe and his assistants in Rome at that time were intent on preparing for another international assembly of the Order, a General Congregation, as such an assembly is called. So he bought time, valuable time. Paul, in his weakness, could find no alternative but to wait. </p><p> Paul did make one last but equally ineffective attempt to recall the allegiance of the Society to the papacy during the ninety-six-day international assembly of Jesuit leaders, the 32nd General Congregation of 1974-1975. His effort met with total incomprehension and stubborn -- some said even self-righteous -- opposition from the Order. Pope and Jesuits simply could not agree. The Jesuits would not obey. Paul was too weak to force the issue farther. </p><p> "When you have people [the Jesuits]," wrote Jesuit Father M. Buckley about Paul's attitude to that 32nd General Congregation, "who do not think they have made errors either in content or procedure, and when they are suspected, resisted or reproved by the very man they are attempting to serve...you have...a very serious religious problem." </p><p> To say the least. </p><p> Cardinal Albino Luciani of Venice was elected to succeed Paul VI on August 26, 1978. Even before he became Pope, he had apparently made up his mind unfavorably about the Society. </p><p> And apparently the Society had already made up its mind about Pope John Paul I. No sooner had he been elected than the Jesuits asserted themselves. Father Vincent O'Keefe, the most prominent of the four General Assistants to Arrupe, and the one being groomed to succeed Arrupe one day as Father General of the Order, told a Dutch newspaper in an interview that the new Pope should reconsider the Church's ban on abortion, homosexuality, and priesthood for women. The interview was published. </p><p> Pope John Paul I was incensed. This was more than contempt. It was an assertion that the Society of Jesus knew better than the Pope what morals Catholics should practice. And it was an assertion that the Society had the authority to speak out; that is, it was a direct appropriation of the authority that belonged exclusively to the papacy. </p><p> John Paul I summoned Arrupe and demanded an explanation. Arrupe humbly promised to look into the whole matter. But John Paul could read the handwriting on the wall as clearly as any Pope. On the basis of Paul VI's critical dossier, and with the help of a very experienced old Jesuit, Father Paolo Dezza, who had been Confessor to Pope Paul VI and now was John Paul I's confessor, the Pope composed a hard-hitting speech of warning. He planned to deliver it to the international assembly of Jesuit leaders and Father General Arrupe at another of their General Congregations to be held in Rome on September 30, 1978. </p><p> One of the striking features of his speech was John Paul I's repeated reference to doctrinal deviations on the part of Jesuits. "Let it not happen that the teachings and publications of Jesuits contain anything to cause confusion among the faithful." Doctrinal deviation was for him the most ominous symptom of Jesuit failure. </p><p> Veiled beneath the polished veneer of its graceful <i>romanit�,</i> that speech contained a clear threat: the Society would return to its proper and assigned role, or the Pope would be forced to take action. </p><p> What action? From John Paul's memoranda and notes, it is clear that, unless a speedy reform of the Order proved feasible, he had in mind the effective liquidation of the Society of Jesus as it is today -- perhaps to be reconstituted later in a more manageable form. John Paul I had received the petitions of many Jesuits, pleading with him to do just that. </p><p> The Pope never delivered that speech of warning. On the morning of September 29, after thirty-three days on the Throne of Peter, and one day before he was to address the Society's General Congregation, John Paul I was found dead in bed. </p><p> In the following days, Jesuit Father General Arrupe petitioned Cardinal Jean Villot, who as Vatican Secretary of State ruled the Holy See in the interim period between John Paul I's death and the election of his successor: Could the Jesuits have a copy of that speech? </p><p> After a discussion with the College of Cardinals who were helping him to prepare for the election of the next pope, the Cardinal prudently refused. Arrupe was told instead that in the opinion of Villot and the Council, "it was high time the Jesuits put their affairs in order." </p><p> For their part, Arrupe and the Jesuits decided to sit the time out and see who would become the next Pope. Time was the commodity they always sought to have. </p><p> More than either of his two immediate predecessors, Karol Wojtyla of Poland, elected as John Paul II on October 16, 1978, could not afford to hesitate in this matter of the Jesuits. John Paul II's grand papal strategy embraced the First World of capitalism, the Second World of Soviet Communism, and the Third World of so-called underdeveloped and developing countries. </p><p> Wojtyla was extremely hard-headed in analyzing the character and limitations of papal strategy since 1945. In his view, Plus XII had guided the Church on the basis of a "siege" mentality, permitting papal strategy only clandestine movement within the Soviet empire, but providing no challenge to the continual erosion of the Church in that area. John XXIII's policy of "open fields" had been a failure. Paul VI's policy had consisted merely of a refinement of an already faulty and failed policy. By the time of Paul VI's death in 1978, his Secretariat of State had managed to work out protocol agreements with more than one member-government of the Soviet Socialist "fraternity," but none had been initialed, let alone signed and sealed into law. In any case, even had those protocols been ratified, it had already become clear enough that they would have made no difference to the status of Roman Catholics under Soviet rule. </p><p> In John Paul II's analysis, as long as the so-called First...</p></p><h2>The Ipcress File (Secret File #1)</h2><p>When a number of scientists mysteriously disappear in Berlin, a seemingly straightforward case rapidly becomes a journey to the heart of a deadly conspiracy--a conspiracy that will test Deighton's working-class hero to the limits of his ingenuity and resolve.

By the time you&#39;re twenty-one, you&#39;ll have seen or heard a million advertisements. But you won&#39;t be happier for it. This is a book about that much-maligned, much-misunderstood generation coming up behind the slackers, who are being intelligent and active about the world in which they find themselves. It is a world in which all that is &#39;alternative&#39; is sold, where any innovation or subversion is immediately adopted by un-radical, faceless corporations. But, gradually, tentatively, a new generation is beginning to fight consumerism with its own best weapons; and it is the first skirmishes in this war that this abrasively intelligent book documents brilliantly.</p><p>We live in an era where image is nearly everything, where the proliferation of brand-name culture has created, to take one hyperbolic example from Naomi Klein's <i>No Logo</i>, "walking, talking, life-sized Tommy [Hilfiger] dolls, mummified in fully branded Tommy worlds." Brand identities are even flourishing online, she notes--and for some retailers, perhaps best of all online: "Liberated from the real-world burdens of stores and product manufacturing, these brands are free to soar, less as the disseminators of goods or services than as collective hallucinations." <p> In <i>No Logo</i>, Klein patiently demonstrates, step by step, how brands have become ubiquitous, not just in media and on the street but increasingly in the schools as well. (The controversy over advertiser-sponsored Channel One may be old hat, but many readers will be surprised to learn about ads in school lavatories and exclusive concessions in school cafeterias.) The global companies claim to support diversity, but their version of "corporate multiculturalism" is merely intended to create more buying options for consumers. When Klein talks about how easy it is for retailers like Wal-Mart and Blockbuster to "censor" the contents of videotapes and albums, she also considers the role corporate conglomeration plays in the process. How much would one expect Paramount Pictures, for example, to protest against Blockbuster's policies, given that they're both divisions of Viacom?</p><p> Klein also looks at the workers who keep these companies running, most of whom never share in any of the great rewards. The president of Borders, when asked whether the bookstore chain could pay its clerks a "living wage," wrote that "while the concept is romantically appealing, it ignores the practicalities and realities of our business environment." Those clerks should probably just be grateful they're not stuck in an Asian sweatshop, making pennies an hour to produce Nike sneakers or other must-have fashion items. Klein also discusses at some length the tactic of hiring "permatemps" who can do most of the work and receive few, if any, benefits like health care, paid vacations, or stock options. While many workers are glad to be part of the "Free Agent Nation," observers note that, particularly in the high-tech industry, such policies make it increasingly difficult to organize workers and advocate for change.</p><p> But resistance is growing, and the backlash against the brands has set in. Street-level education programs have taught kids in the inner cities, for example, not only about Nike's abusive labor practices but about the astronomical markup in their prices. Boycotts have commenced: as one urban teen put it, "Nike, we made you. We can break you." But there's more to the revolution, as Klein optimistically recounts: "Ethical shareholders, culture jammers, street reclaimers, McUnion organizers, human-rights hacktivists, school-logo fighters and Internet corporate watchdogs are at the early stages of demanding a citizen-centered alternative to the international rule of the brands ... as global, and as capable of coordinated action, as the multinational corporations it seeks to subvert." <i>No Logo</i> is a comprehensive account of what the global economy has wrought and the actions taking place to thwart it. <i>--Ron Hogan</i></p>There's a bad mood rising against the corporate brands. No Logo is the warning on the label. <p>Once a poster boy for the new economy, Bill Gates has become global whipping boy. Nike's swoosh - the marketing success of the nineties - is now equated with sweatshop labour, and teenage MacDonald's workers are joining the Teamsters. What is going on? No Logo, an incisive and insightful report from the frontlines of mounting backlash against multinational corporations, explains why some of the most revered brands in the world are finding themselves on the wrong end of a bottle of spray paint, a computer hack, or an international anti-corporate campaign.</p> <p>No Logo uncovers a betrayal of the central promises of the information age: choice, interactivity, and increased freedom. And as job security disappears, the respectful reverence which corporations enjoyed as engines of the economy is also dissipating - as is their protection from worker and citizen rage.</p> <p>Equal parts cultural analysis, political manifesto, mall-rat memoir, and journalistic expos�, No Logo is the first book to put the new resistance into pop-historical and clear economic perspective. Naomi Klein tells a story of rebellion and self-determination in the face of our new branded world.</p></p><h2>Hubble Legacy Edition</h2><p>Narrative by Giles Sparrow. Legacy Edition.

By the author of Something in the Water.</p><p><p>Charlotte MacLeod (1922-2005) was an internationally bestselling author of cozy mysteries. Born in Canada, she moved to Boston as a child, and lived in New England most of her life. After graduating from college, she made a career in advertising, writing copy for the Stop &amp; Shop Supermarket Company before moving on to Boston firm N. H. Miller &amp; Co., where she rose to the rank of vice president. In her spare time, MacLeod wrote short stories, and in 1964 published her first novel, a children's book called Mystery of the White Knight.&nbsp;</p> <p></p>Reaching for too many laughs, MacLeod falls flat with the 12th entry in her Sarah Kelling and Max Bittersohn series (after Something in the Water). The title refers to Sarah's duties as unexpected executrix of the will of bossy Dolores Tawne, administrator of Boston's Wilkins Museum, who has been stabbed to death with an antique hairpin (a method, Sarah observes, written about by famed archeologist Amelia Peabody Emerson, Elizabeth Peters's series heroine). Among Dolores's effects is a safe deposit box she left unopened for 30 years. The box contains six antique stickpins and a photograph of the Wicked Widows, a group of seven masked street performers who, it turns out, are wanted for the murders of four Boston policemen some years ago. Relying on disguises and guesswork, Sarah triumphs in a final melodramatic scene. The meandering narrative, aimless chatter and absence of Sarah's husband, Max, who's in Argentina, sabotage this effort. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Tender Is the Night (Reissue)</h2><p>The story of a promising young psychiatrist whose unfortunate marriage drives him into obscurity</p><p>In the wake of World War I, a community of expatriate American writers established itself in the salons and cafes of 1920s Paris. They congregated at Gertrude Stein's select soirees, drank too much, married none too wisely, and wrote volumes--about the war, about the Jazz Age, and often about each other. F. Scott Fitzgerald and his wife, Zelda, were part of this gang of literary Young Turks, and it was while living in France that Fitzgerald began writing <i>Tender Is the Night</i>. Begun in 1925, the novel was not actually published until 1934. By then, Fitzgerald was back in the States and his marriage was on the rocks, destroyed by Zelda's mental illness and alcoholism. Despite the modernist mandate to keep authors and their creations strictly segregated, it's difficult <i>not</i> to look for parallels between Fitzgerald's private life and the lives of his characters, psychiatrist Dick Diver and his former patient turned wife, Nicole. Certainly the hospital in Switzerland where Zelda was committed in 1929 provided the inspiration for the clinic where Diver meets, treats, and then marries the wealthy Nicole Warren. And Fitzgerald drew both the European locale and many of the characters from places and people he knew from abroad.<p> In the novel, Dick is eventually ruined--professionally, emotionally, and spiritually--by his union with Nicole. Fitzgerald's fate was not quite so novelistically neat: after Zelda was diagnosed as a schizophrenic and committed, Fitzgerald went to work as a Hollywood screenwriter in 1937 to pay her hospital bills. He died three years later--not melodramatically, like poor Jay Gatsby in his swimming pool, but prosaically, while eating a chocolate bar and reading a newspaper. Of all his novels, <i>Tender Is the Night</i> is arguably the one closest to his heart. As he himself wrote, "<i>Gatsby</i> was a tour de force, but this is a confession of faith."</p>In Tender Is The Night, Fitzgerald deliberately set out to write the most ambitious and far-reaching novel of his career, experimenting radically with narrative conventions of chronology and point of view and drawing on early breakthroughs in psychiatry to enrich his account of the makeup and breakdown of character and culture.</p><h2>The Book of Miracles</h2><p><p>The Book of Miracles first surfaced only a few years ago and is one of the most spectacular discoveries in the field of Renaissance art.

Accepting the offer of my Latin teacher for me to do an extra translation to improve my grade, I produced a fully illustrated dummy of <i>Little Red Riding Hood</i>-in Latin, and set in the appropriate period of history. I also didn't know that it would be a long time before my artistic and intellectual interests would work together side by side quite so neatly again.</p><p>"I went to Sarah Lawrence College planning to study art, and ended up with a concentration in American history. I earned a Master's degree in history at Columbia University but never gave up my longing to draw and paint. Some years later I took a class in printmaking at Manhattanville College, and it was there that everything started to come together. I was working on a series of etchings illustrating a tale by Rudyard Kipling, and my very wise teacher, John Ross, suggested children's books.</p><p>"By then I was the mother of two small children and lived with my pediatrician husband in a rural town in Connecticut. I used whatever quiet hours I could find to put together a portfolio, and what little energy remained to take a course in illustration at the Parsons School of Design. I arrived at Greenwillow in 1981 with a pile of drawings for stories that existed somewhere in my head. Susan Hirschman pulled one out and told me to go home and write the story-in a week, no less! Well, somehow I did it, and the sense of unity I had felt back in Latin class was mine again.</p><p>"Since that first book, which was called Cromwell's Glasses, there have been many, many stories. Some come from my own childhood (frequently changed just enough to make them turn out more to my liking!), some come from the experiences of my children, and, more recently, some have come from the places to which I have traveled.</p><p>"In all the years that I have been writing and illustrating children's books, it has never felt like work.

Among the magazines he has top-edited: <i>Outside, Rolling Stone, Esquire,&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Sports Illustrated.&nbsp;</i>In this revealing memoir, McDonell talks about what really happens when editors and writers work with deadlines ticking (or drinks on the bar).

Norman Mailer actually complained about this. Vietnam had a lot to do with it because friends had been there, or had gone and weren&#x2019;t coming back. And there was The Movement, however you defined it, and the music and the drugs, and everyone drank and had sex with each other. No one wants to read any more about that, but there was a shocking inevitability to the way things were turning out.<br><br> Something else was always there too, just beneath the surface, no matter how uncomfortable or embarrassing it was to define. Writers talked about it, about writing and being writers. Ken Kesey said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;d rather be a lightning rod than a seismograph.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s the kind of writer we all wanted to be. What if writers <i>were </i>the story? What an idea.<br><br> Depending on how well you wrote and how often you changed&nbsp;jobs or assignments, other writers came in and out of your life. Some of them were already famous and others would be soon, but celebrity didn&#x2019;t matter because you knew something together&#x2014;the private thrill that comes from writing a clear and unique sentence. The craft of it. James Salter liked to &#x201c;rub words in his hand, to turn them around and feel them.&#x201d; Writing is exactly that, and there is no work like it because it is so complicated to know when you are done. Riffing about writing journalism, Renata Adler wrote, in her novel <i>Speedboat, </i>about giving &#x201c;a piece of sugar to a raccoon, which in its odd fastidiousness would wash that sugar in a brook till there was nothing left.&#x201d;<br><br>Editors can help with that.<br> &nbsp;<br> Before I became &nbsp;an &nbsp;editor, &nbsp;I had an intuition about what&nbsp;readers wanted: they wanted to read whatever I wanted to write. Sure they did. I just needed a little editing sometimes. Every editor I ever had, including the bad ones, was strict about a piece living or dying by its language&#x2014;even if they couldn&#x2019;t write themselves, which of course they couldn&#x2019;t. That&#x2019;s why they were editors. Or so I thought until I met the editor who made me an editor.<br>&nbsp; <br>His name was Bob Sherrill&#x2014;<i>the Other </i>Bob Sherrill. He used <i>the Other </i>to distinguish himself from Robert Sherrill, the writer who had just published <i>The Saturday Night Special, </i>a book about handguns so smart that <i>the Other </i>Bob Sherrill said you just wanted to hold it up to your forehead. <i>The Other </i>Bob Sherrill was Robert Sherrill&#x2019;s editor for a while, and he was my editor, too.<br><br>At forty-one, he was known in the magazine world to be crazy and shrewd and kind all at once. He was said to be especially good with young writers, and was also known for outdressing them in his white high-top Chuck Taylors with the fluorescent red laces (untied), his baggy blue-and-white seersucker suits and his black T-shirts, a green-and-pink silk bandanna around his neck and a Black Watch beret over his shaggy strawberry blond hair. Plus his Ray-Bans, rain or shine. Bob was colorful.<br><br>He was also a bit surreal, a flipped-out literary ice-cream man, but handsome too, and women liked him, and I worked for him as a reporter at a start-up weekly called <i>LA </i>that we were saying was like, you know, &#x201c;the <i>Village Voice, </i>but for Los Angeles.&#x201d; Bob never said that, though. He had come west on an &#x201c;editorial whim&#x201d; (his phrase) after some turbulent years in New York at <i>Esquire, </i>where he had been a sly packager and helped &#x201c;midwife&#x201d; (ditto) journalistic innovations from Dubious Achievements to that genre-cracking run of pieces that defined the New Journalism. Tom Wolfe, Gay Talese, Truman Capote, Mailer&#x2014;every writer in the country knew the grow- ing roll call and wanted to be on it. Bob had edited many of them and liked to talk about how they got their story ideas.<br><br>&#x201c;From editors, of course,&#x201d; he would say, riding shotgun with a Mexican beer between his knees, motoring around Southern California&nbsp;with one or another of the young writers who worked for&nbsp;Bob had hired me thinking he was getting a solid wire service reporter, which I was not&#x2014;although I had spent time in Beirut and Amman during the 1970 Jordanian civil war that became known as Black September and had been picked up by AP News features in New York. What I was, was ambitious and that&#x2019;s what Bob said he liked about my story ideas&#x2014;that, and that I had been reading <i>Esquire </i>since high school, was a little older than the other reporters, and had the best car. <br><br>Bob would never let you use <i>eventful </i>in a piece but this particular day was that for me, driving us both down the coast in my Fiat convert- ible to a party in Dana Point thrown by a former AP reporter named Pat McNulty, who had reinvented himself as the editor of <i>Surfer </i>mag- azine. I knew McNulty and the invitation had come through me. When I&#x2019;d told Bob about it, I&#x2019;d said there would be surfers for sure but also journalists, maybe a couple novelists, and also people in the new MFA program at U.C. Irvine, where McNulty was teaching. If there was a West Coast literary &#x201c;scene&#x201d; (a word Bob liked) to match up with Tom Wolfe&#x2019;s recent piece on surf culture, &#x201c;The Pump House Gang,&#x201d; this would be it.<br><br>I knew Bob would be the center of the party as he always was wherever writers and alcohol came together. All the way down the Pacific Coast Highway we talked story ideas. Bob was warming up for the writers who would soon be circling for a chance to talk to him, all of them wanting to break trail for an assignment from <i>Esquire, </i>where he was still a contributing editor. Somewhere near Laguna Beach I said something about how anybody interested in journalism (like me) would want to read a piece by someone like Wolfe or Talese or Mailer or anyone good on Bob himself, and what was about to hap- pen to him at the party.<br><br>Bob had a way of cocking his head when he was enjoying whatever he was thinking. That&#x2019;s what he did then, and told me <i>he </i>thought <i>I </i>thought like an editor and we should <i>both </i>think about <i>that. </i>Think about me becoming an editor. Think about making magazines.<br> &#x201c;Think about monkeys jumping out of boxes,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what&nbsp;good editors do.&#x201d; I had not heard that one but figured he was talking about jack-in-the-box surprises. I nodded. He cocked his head again. I waited.<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;Plus,&#x201d; he said, taking another pull from his Tecate, &#x201c;good editors never have to drive.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br><br>Word Count (320)<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Editing is about ideas, but it is mechanical, too. You have to get under the hood of the language, and editors use many tools. I&#x2019;ll start by leaving the word counts at the top of my chapters because as an editor I always wanted to know how much I was about to read. This helped me evaluate pacing or the lack of it in a piece. Writers were sensitive to this once they found out how I worked, and were generally attuned to length, even if they weren&#x2019;t being paid by the word.<br> &nbsp;<br> At all the magazines I edited (<i>Rolling Stone, Esquire, Sports Illustrated</i>, et al.), feature stories were assigned at a specific length&#x2014; usually four thousand words&#x2014;and most writers would take that over five thousand and say they were close. Others would come in under three thousand and say the same thing. It was mysterious why being direct about the number of words they were filing was so difficult but I am sure it had more to do with alchemy than lack of discipline. Before Microsoft Word, stopping to count how many words you&#x2019;d typed could be refreshing, like stopping to make tea or smoke a cigarette. Now doing a word count can have a slot machine kick to it if you have the discipline not to do it every time you hit Save.<br> &nbsp;<br> None of this matters if the piece is good&#x2014;and that&#x2019;s determined by voice and narrative, not length. Going long is always more ambitious and usually more fun. This was true before lengthy pieces became &#x201c;creative nonfiction&#x201d; or &#x201c;narrative journalism,&#x201d; and it is true now that we&#x2019;ve finally debunked the simple-minded Web assumption that no one will screen-read anything longer than a news capsule. No writer I ever edited wanted to go short, anyway. Neither do I, but I also know that the best pieces seem to find their own length. That&#x2019;s the alchemy.<br> &nbsp;<br>Jim Harrison (525)<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The first chapter of Jim Harrison&#x2019;s first novel, Wolf, begins with a two-page sentence. He says it was vanity, that he wanted to show it could be done because he was a young writer and hungry.<br> &nbsp;<br> That was in 1971. A few years later when I was starting to work with him, I asked if his editor had tried to do something with that first sentence.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; he said wearily, as if in my tragic inexperience I was unable to grasp the basic construct of editing him. Jim did little revising and was proud of it. Rewriting was for people who hadn&#x2019;t worked everything out early&#x2014;not for Jim, who insisted that he always thought things through before he wrote anything down. As for edi- tors, why should he let them fool with his choices? They were not, as he had explained to me when we first met, writers. He also liked to note that he was a poet and &#x201c;editors don&#x2019;t change poems.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t change any of your poems either,&#x201d; I said, but when it came to his journalism I wasn&#x2019;t so sure. Being above editing was a pose some writers found situationally useful, the way some children are &#x201c;allergic&#x201d; to lima beans. It was the foot Jim liked to get off on and, sure enough, we tangled over copy our first time around. I was at Outside magazine and suggested that his lede on a story about Key West was really the second paragraph and the first paragraph should be the kicker at the end of the piece. He hung up on me.<br> &nbsp;<br> I got an immediate follow-up call from his agent, Bob Datilla, a tough, reasonable guy.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You want to pull the piece?&#x201d; I asked, after his declension of my shortcomings.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Of course not,&#x201d; Datilla said. &#x201c;We just want to be on the record about what a dumb shit you are.&#x201d; (Pause.) &#x201c;But Jim can be difficult, too.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;So we&#x2019;ll all think about it?&#x201d; I said. <br> &#x201c;Exactly.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;m not sure how much we all thought about it, but I switched the paragraphs to what I&#x2019;d suggested and we never discussed the piece again. Maybe Jim didn&#x2019;t notice. But I learned to tread lightly or risk being told, as I once was by him, &#x201c;You lynched my baby.&#x201d; His raw copy was so ambitious that I usually just checked the copy edit and wrote the headline. We talked about other things, like what we were having for dinner, as well as what we were reading. My working relationship with Jim and other writers, my growing friendships with them, was nourished by even the mundane details of their lives.<br> &nbsp;<br> In <i>Wolf</i>, Jim wrote, Perhaps I&#x2019;ll never see a wolf. And I don&#x2019;t offer this little problem as central to anyone but myself. Fair enough. As a reader, I took that as a glance at a private mystery. As an editor, I wanted that wolf to be my problem, too. I wanted to ride along. I hoped that was how I could become a good editor, by editing great writers and getting to know them.

According to this groundbreaking study, the interaction among masters, slaves, serfs and native nonslaves in ancient times gave rise to both the concept of freedom and a commitment to it. Harvard sociology professor Patterson argues that male, small-time farmers, through their relations with large-scale, slaveholding counterparts, gave birth to civic freedom as a value. He further contends that it was women who invented the ideal of personal freedom, which was closely linked to justice, and being true to oneself and to "significant others." Challenging conventional readings of the so-called Dark Ages, Patterson holds that chords of freedom resounded through the medieval period. First half of a projected two-volume opus, this intellectually rich work redefines a whole field of inquiry as it ranges over Greek tragedy and philosophy, Roman history, the emergence of Christianity, and medieval secular and religious thought. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.Patterson, a Harvard sociologist, argues that the idea of freedom is the supreme value in the Western world and increasingly so in the rest of the world. This book, the first of a projected two-volume inquiry, seeks to answer the question of how it became such a powerful and popular value. His basic thesis is that freedom as a value derived from the experience of slavery in the ancient world. He then traces the fate of the idea of freedom in the Roman empire, during the rise of Christianity, and in the Middle Ages. He further distinguishes between personal, sovereign, and civic freedom and analyzes the potential evils in each of these freedoms; e.g., personal liberty has led to unbridled capitalism, sovereign freedom to dictatorship, and civic freedom to the oppression of minorities.

Patricia Cline Cohen goes behind these first lurid accounts to reconstruct the story of the mysterious victim, Helen Jewett. <br><br>From her beginnings as a servant girl in Maine, Helen Jewett refashioned herself, using four successive aliases, into a highly paid courtesan. She invented life stories for herself that helped her build a sympathetic clientele among New York City's elite, and she further captivated her customers through her seductive letters, which mixed elements of traditional feminine demureness with sexual boldness.<br><br>But she was to meet her match--and her nemesis--in a youth called Richard Robinson. He was one of an unprecedented number of young men who flooded into America's burgeoning cities in the 1830s to satisfy the new business society's seemingly infinite need for clerks. The son of an established Connecticut family, he was intense, arrogant, and given to posturing. He became Helen Jewett's lover in a tempestuous affair and ten months later was arrested for her murder. He stood trial in a five-day courtroom drama that ended with his acquittal amid the cheers of hundreds of fellow clerks and other spectators.<br><br>With no conviction for murder, nor closure of any sort, the case continued to tantalize the public, even though Richard Robinson disappeared from view. Through the Erie Canal, down the Ohio and the Mississippi, and by way of New Orleans, he reached the wilds of Texas and a new life under a new name. Through her meticulous and ingenious research, Patricia Cline Cohen traces his life there and the many twists and turns of the lingering mystery of the murder. Her stunning portrayals of Helen Jewett, Robinson, and their raffish, colorful nineteenth-century world make vivid a frenetic city life and sexual morality whose complexities, contradictions, and concerns resonate with those of our own time.</p><p>In 1836, the murder of young New York City prostitute Helen Jewett and the ensuing trial of her lover captivated the nation. Jewett (her real name was Dorcas Doyen; Jewett used many pseudonyms during her short life) was an archetypal 1830s model of fallen virtue. A bright, literate girl who worked as a servant for a respected Maine family, Jewett became "disgraced," losing her virginity outside of wedlock, and eventually taking up work as a prostitute in bustling New York City. One of her clients, Richard Robinson, was a young clerk of uncommon literary talent. The two exchanged a long series of letters, often loving and careful, then as quickly as a summer storm, they turned violent and angry. Early on the morning of April 10, 1836, Robinson stabbed Jewett to death in her brothel room and set fire to her bed. Robinson was eventually acquitted of the crime despite an overwhelming amount of evidence that both placed him at the scene and his hand on the murder weapon. The decision was universally reviled, and Robinson became an outcast who eventually exiled himself to Texas.<p> Cohen ably places this rather ordinary crime within the context of 19th-century urban life and the development of a fledgling tabloid journalism, showing just how people throughout America came to be shocked by a crime that might otherwise have gone unnoticed. <i>The Murder of Helen Jewett</i> is as much about mores and customs as it is about a lost soul. <i>--Tjames Madison</i></p>"This is a wonderfully vivid work of detection and history. It unravels a murder mystery at the same time that it weaves a rich historical tapestry. It brings to life New York in the 1830s, and yet it bears an eerie similarity to one of the most infamous murder trials of our time.

He is human but a different sort of human from the rest of us: he was born (in the ladies&#x2019; washroom of a train station in England in 1919), he lives a certain number of years, and he dies&#x2014;and then he&#x2019;s born again, right back where he started, and a handful of years later his memories of his first life return. Harry is, like a few others, a kalachakra, an immortal who is constantly reborn, each time with all the memories of his previous lives. This wonderful novel, narrated by Harry, ranges back and forth in time as he recounts episodes from his various lives, but it&#x2019;s all held together by a compelling mystery involving nothing less than the end of the world itself (a thousand years in the future). Beautifully written and structured, the book should be a big hit with SF fans.

Now, Antonia Fraser goes behind the well-known tales of Louis&#x2019;s accomplishments and follies, exploring in riveting detail his intimate relationships with women.<br><br>The king&#x2019;s mother, Anne of Austria, had been in a childless marriage for twenty-two years before she gave birth to Louis XIV. A devout Catholic, she instilled in her son a strong sense of piety and fought successfully for his right to absolute power. In 1660, Louis married his first cousin, Marie-Th�r�se, in a political arrangement. While unfailingly kind to the official "Queen of Versailles," Louis sought others to satisfy his romantic and sexual desires. After a flirtation with his sister-in-law, his first important mistress was Louise de La Valli�re, who bore him several children before being replaced by the tempestuous and brilliant Ath�na�s, marquise de Montespan. Later, when Ath�na�s&#x2019;s reputation was tarnished, the king continued to support her publicly until Ath�na�s left court for a life of repentance. Meanwhile her children&#x2019;s governess, the intelligent and seemingly puritanical Fran�oise de Maintenon, had already won the king&#x2019;s affections; in a relationship in complete contrast to his physical obsession with Ath�na�s, Louis XIV lived happily with Madame de Maintenon for the rest of his life, very probably marrying her in secret.

When Louis, her first child, was born on 5 September 1638 the Spanish-born Queen of France was just short of her thirty-seventh birthday. This was an age at which a royal princess might well expect to be a grandmother (Anne herself had been married at fourteen). The Queen had on the contrary endured twenty-two years of childless union. Anne, as she told a confidante, had even feared the annulment of her marriage, since childlessness was one possible ground for repudiation according to the Catholic Church. In which case the former Spanish Princess, daughter of Philip III, would either have been returned to her native country or possibly dispatched to govern the so-called &#x2018;Spanish&#x2019; Netherlands (approximately modern Belgium), as other princesses of her royal house had done, most recently her pious aunt, Isabella Clara Eugenia.<br><br>The birth of a child, and that child a son &#x2014; females could not inherit in France under the fourteenth-century Salic Law &#x2014; meant that the whole position of his royal mother was transformed. It was not only the obvious delight of a woman confronted with &#x2018;a marvel when it was least expected&#x2019;, as the official newspaper <i>Gazette de France </i>put it. It was also the traditionally strong position of any Queen of France who had produced a Dauphin, an interesting paradox in the land of the Salic Law. This strength derived from the claim of such a Queen to act as Regent should her husband die during the minority of her son; a rule which had applied to Louis XIII&#x2019;s mother when Henri IV had died, and the dominating Catherine de M�dicis in the previous century. <br><br>It was a situation that had already been envisaged at the time of Anne of Austria&#x2019;s betrothal in 1612. In poetical language the future Queen was described as the moon to her husband&#x2019;s sun: &#x2018;Just as the moon borrows its light from the sun . . .&#x2019; the monarch&#x2019;s death means that &#x2018;the setting sun gives way to the moon and confers on it the power of shedding light in its absence&#x2019;. (The potential bride and bridegroom were then both ten years old.) A quarter of a century later, the reality was less poetical. Louis XIII was not in good health and a Regency in the next thirteen years &#x2014; the age at which a French King reached his majority &#x2014; was more likely than not. How long would it be before Anne, like Catherine de M�dicis, was promoting herself as an image of revered maternality at the heart of government?<br><br>Furthermore the dynastic map of Europe was transformed. The heir presumptive to the throne of France, the King&#x2019;s younger brother Gaston Duc d&#x2019;Orl�ans, on being shown &#x2018;physical proofs&#x2019; of the baby&#x2019;s masculinity, had to accept that his rising hopes of accession had been fatally dashed. But Gaston himself had only daughters. Next in line were the French Princes of the Blood, notably the Prince de Cond� and his two sons the Duc d&#x2019;Enghien and the Prince de Conti; their hopes were similarly blighted.<br><br>On the other hand the birth of a prince not only cut off hopes but also instigated ambitious thoughts of his eventual marriage to a princess. Gaston&#x2019;s daughter by his first marriage, Anne-Marie-Louise de Montpensier, was the richest heiress in France from the fortune of her mother who had died at her birth. She did not allow an eleven-year gap in age to prevent her dallying with thoughts of the Dauphin as &#x2018;my little husband&#x2019;. Even more significant for the future was another equally august birth in Spain. Five days after the ecstatic Queen Anne gave birth to Louis, her sister-in-law, wife of Philip IV, gave birth to a princess.<br><br>These two high-born babies were in fact double first cousins (with identical grandparents), since a brother and a sister of France had married a brother and a sister of Spain. Unlike France, however, Spain allowed females to succeed: Anne of Austria had had to renounce her own rights on her marriage. There was at least a theoretical possibility that the Infanta Maria Teresa would one day succeed to the throne of Spain &#x2014; or her children would. Another theoretical possibility, always present in the mind of Queen Anne, was that Maria Teresa might one day make a bride for Louis. <br><br>Under the circumstances, it is easy to understand how the infant Louis was described as &#x2018;Dieudonn�&#x2019; or &#x2018;Deodatus&#x2019;: Godgiven. And even as the years passed, the apparently miraculous nature of his conception and birth was never forgotten. One German diplomat would refer to the King&#x2019;s &#x2018;quite extraordinary birth&#x2019; over forty years after the event.<br>How miraculous was this birth, so unexpected and so awe-inspiring for the mother? Certainly a great deal of prayer had been applied to the subject as the years passed. There were pilgrimages to shrines, as befitted a Queen who throughout her life liked nothing so much as to visit convents and holy places. Saint Leonard was invoked against sterility; a hermit who was believed to have founded a monastery near Limoges in the sixth century, his intercession was held responsible for many miracles. (He was otherwise the patron saint of prisoners &#x2014; and after all the Queen was in the prison of her infertility.)<br><br>The Queen was fast approaching the age at which child-bearing itself was felt to be unlikely. This was a period when women were generally held to age faster than men, losing their bloom early &#x2014; &#x2018;no woman is beautiful after twenty-two&#x2019; was a popular saying &#x2014; going further downhill after thirty. Certainly, by the time of the Queen&#x2019;s thirty-sixth birthday on 22 September 1637 &#x2014; and thirty-five was often seen as a cut-off point &#x2014; her relationship with her husband, and also with her adopted country of France, had already had a long and troubled history.<br><br>The marriage of the two royal teenagers took place on the feast of St Catherine &#x2014; 25 November &#x2014; 1615. It was, it seems, consummated immediately, and after that there was a gap of more than three years. The twenty-fifth of January 1619 was the auspicious date on which the further completion of the royal union was announced in the gazette <i>Mercure Fran�ais</i> (it was after all a matter of state, just as the marriage had been). There were certainly rumours of royal pregnancies throughout the 1620s, and Louis XIII himself told the Venetian Ambassador later that his Queen had had four &#x2018;wretched miscarriages&#x2019;.<br><br>If the marriage was not egregiously unhappy by royal standards &#x2014; notoriously low &#x2014; it was certainly unhappy enough. Anne was an extremely attractive, even beautiful woman with her full, voluptuous figure, her thick bright chestnut hair, her luminous pale skin and her dark eyes with the green glints which gave them a special sparkle. She had her share of feminine vanity and was especially proud of her much-admired white hands, which seemed made &#x2018;to hold a sceptre&#x2019;. As for her character, that was made up of contradictions. Anne was certainly pleasure-loving &#x2014; she adored the theatre and gambling &#x2014; but at the same time she was extremely pious.<br><br>Her piety did not stop Queen Anne from being a romantic, and it was not difficult for men to fall in love with her: &#x2018;her smile won a thousand hearts,&#x2019; wrote Madame de Motteville, her lady-in-waiting. She was also <i>galante</i> in the crucial French term of the time which shimmers with different meanings throughout this period. In the case of the Queen, it meant flirtatious in the courtly, essentially innocent manner of the well-chaperoned Spanish Infanta she had once been. When the handsome Duke of Buckingham, who was gallant in every sense of the word, had &#x2018;the audacity&#x2019; to court her in a famous scene in a garden, the Queen recoiled in horror. Nevertheless, in the opinion of Madame de Motteville, an important source for Anne&#x2019;s intimate feelings because she understood the Spanish world, &#x2018;if a respectable woman could love a man other than her husband, it would have been Buckingham who appealed to her&#x2019;. The Princesse de Conti had a more cynical view: she would vouch for the Queen&#x2019;s virtue from the waist down, but not from the waist up.<br><br>The sexuality of the husband of this romantic and unfulfilled woman was what would now be called troubled. Louis XIII formed lugubrious attachments to both men and women: late in his life, the Marquis de Cinq-Mars became his favourite. But at one point<br>Louis fell yearningly in love with Marie d&#x2019;Hautefort (his conjugal visits to Anne were said to have increased in consequence). However, when his friend the Duc de Saint-Simon offered to act as a go-between, the King was shocked: &#x2018;the more my rank as king gives me the facility to satisfy myself,&#x2019; he said, &#x2018;the more I must guard against sin and scandal.&#x2019; Low-spirited and willingly dominated by his great minister Cardinal Richelieu, Louis XIII was one half of an incompatible pair.<br><br>Furthermore, if the marriage did not provide a Bourbon&#x2014;Habsburg heir, it did not bring about peace between Bourbon and Habsburg kingdoms either. Not long after Anne came to France, the slow strangulation of Europe in that long and complicated conflict known later as the Thirty Years War began. In this conflict, at the instigation of Cardinal Richelieu, the French and Spanish found themselves on different sides. Anne rejected the idea that she remained at heart a Spanish princess. Her tastes might be Spanish, from a predilection for late hours to a yearning for Spanish iced drinks and Spanish chocolate, but s...</p><h2>PREPPER&#x2019;S 1ST BOOK OF USEFUL GARDEN AND WILD PLANTS: Information that could help save your life!

The son of a textile magnate, he dropped out of public school aged sixteen and spent much of his early career among criminals. The Factory series followed his early novels, The Crust on Its Uppers and A State of Denmark. He died in London in 1994.First published in the U.K. in 1990, Raymond's searing fourth entry in his Factory series (<i>The Devil's Home on Leave</i>, etc.) opens with a psychopath hurling an old lady to her death against her grandfather clock&#x2014;just after he took an ax to young Dora Suarez in a neighboring flat. That same night, the killer shoots Felix Roatta&#x2014;part-owner of a seedy London club, who's expecting money from the killer&#x2014;with a gun loaded with a soft-tip bullet (The upper part of Roatta's head entirely disappeared). Matters wind up in the hands of an unnamed narrator, a police sergeant, who (� la <i>Laura</i>) begins to develop an unhealthy fixation on Dora. Though some may find the sanguinary detail overdone, it's somehow rendered a shade less objectionable when translated into the British idiom. Raymond (1931&#x2013;1994) was a prime practitioner of the not-so-gentle art of murder, Brit-style, and if anyone wants a sample of his wares, this is a fine place to start. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

As she lifted her nose and sniffed the air, the hair on the back of her neck rose. She could smell the danger. Every instinct she had told her to turn and run, but the pup beside her had needs she couldn't provide.<br><br>At that moment the pup whined. When she turned and licked its dusty face, it wiggled with pleasure. As much as she would like to lie down, time was not on her side. She nudged the pup gently until it latched on to her pelt. With a single whine of reassurance, she started forward, confident that it would follow as she started down the gentle slope into the valley below. <br><br>* * *<br>The spring sunshine in Snow Valley was a welcome respite from the bitter Alaskan winter and the months without sunlight. It took a special kind of people to be at peace with a world that had months without sunlight, then months without darkness, but the native Inuits were just such a people. It took more than funky geography and quixotic weather patterns to stagger them. They'd been here for centuries and were at peace with their world.<br><br>Today, a brisk wind was coming down from the slopes, whipping among the simple wood-frame buildings housing the hunting camp and the small contingent of people who lived there, popping and yanking at the fresh laundry the women had hanging on their clotheslines.<br><br>A bush pilot named Harve Dubois, originally from Biloxi, Mississippi, had a small house on the south edge of the tiny settlement, next to the landing strip, which was the only way in and out of the camp. He'd been in residence for almost twelve years now and considered himself a replanted Alaskan. During the different hunting seasons, he flew hunters in and out of the area with his Bell Jet copter. In the off-seasons, he had a propensity for hibernation, at which times he retreated to his cabin with a case of Jim Beam and a grocery sack full of paperback thrillers.<br><br>Doctor Adam Lawson lived on the other edge of the hunting camp. He'd been brought in more than six years ago on a mercy mission when an unfortunate hunter had met up with a pissed-off grizzly. The hunter's gun had jammed, and then the grizzly had jammed him up one side and down the other. By the time the doctor had patched the hunter up enough to be flown out, he'd fallen for the people and the place. He'd come back the next spring on his own and had been there ever since.<br><br>A man named Silas Parker was the owner of the camp and lived and worked in a small, two-story A-frame. The lower floor was devoted to a sort of grocery and dry goods store, in which he stocked a wide variety of ammunition and a lesser amount of canned and dry goods. The second floor, which amounted to two very small rooms, was where he lived and slept.<br><br>The rest of the residents of Snow Valley were mostly Inuit and had been here longer than God. At least, that was what Harve claimed. Adam Lawson figured it was just the opposite. God had put them here. They'd just had the good sense to stay. The Inuit men were good hunting guides, and a large number of them were often away from the camp with hunting parties for long periods of time, which periodically left the women and children alone.<br><br>The recent good weather had spawned a flurry of expeditions, which meant the women were taking advantage of extra time alone to do a little spring cleaning. With the below-zero temperatures behind them, the good weather also allowed their children to play out in the fresh air and sunshine.<br><br>Some of the older children were involved in a game of softball. Others were playing tag or hide and seek. A pair of six-year-old twins who went by the names of Shorty and Bubba were sitting in the middle of the road that snaked through the village, drawing pictures in the dirt with sticks.<br><br>As they sat, a strong burst of wind lifted the dirt in which they were playing, blowing bits of grass and sand into their eyes. Shorty, the older twin, frowned and closed his eyes, while Bubba, the taller one, quickly turned away, shielding his face from the debris. As he turned, he happened to look up the road. Seconds later, he jumped to his feet, squinting his eyes against the sun, unable to believe what he was seeing. Then suddenly reality surfaced. He grabbed his twin by the hair, and started pulling on him and screaming, "Run, Shorty, run!"<br><br>Shorty reacted without question. Together, he and Bubba ran full tilt for their house, which was less than fifty yards away, screaming as they went. Their screams brought not only their mother, Willa, running, but others, as well.<br><br>"Mama, Mama...wolf!" Bubba screamed as he pointed up the road.<br><br>Willa needed only one look to begin echoing his cries.<br><br>"Wolf! Wolf!" she screamed, and began shoving her boys toward the house as the other women began a frantic search for their own children, desperate to get them inside. <br><br>* * *<br>The she-wolf stopped. She heard the screams. She smelled their fear. It was all the warning she was going to get. She wanted&#x2014;needed&#x2014;to run in the opposite direction. But the pup's tug on her hair matched the tug of instinct that kept her from abandoning it to an uncertain fate. It was that fierce, motherly instinct that gave her the courage to continue on, moving slowly with her head lowered to accommodate the little brown pup now clinging to her ear.<br><br>Silas Parker heard the commotion. Curious, he put down the cans he was shelving and moved toward the front door. It didn't take him long to see what was happening. A big gray wolf was coming into the village. Her walk was slow, and sometimes she staggered, with her head low to the ground. There was only one reason he could think of as to why a wild animal like that would come into the camp.<br><br>Rabies.<br><br>Silas had once seen a man die from the disease and didn't want to ever witness such suffering again.<br><br>He ran behind the counter, lifted his rifle from the rack on the wall, grabbed a handful of shells from a box beneath the counter and began loading the rifle on the run.<br><br>"Get inside! Get inside!" he shouted, as he started down the road. He wasn't much of a shot, which meant he was going to have to get closer to ensure a hit, and he didn't want to have to be dodging kids and women to take aim.<br><br>Another woman came out of her house with her rifle as Silas ran past. He could hear the unsteady sound of her breathing as she struggled to catch up.<br><br>He was still shaking from the burst of adrenaline as he neared Harve's landing strip. The wolf was close, almost too close. Afraid to go any farther, he stopped, lifted the rifle to his shoulder and took aim. Counting slowly backward from five to steady his breathing, he tightened his finger on the trigger and had started to squeeze when the woman who'd been coming up behind him suddenly screamed in his ear, then shoved the rifle up into the air.<br><br>"Don't shoot!"<br><br>He flinched. Marie Tlingtik's shout was not only startling, but confusing. He turned abruptly.<br><br>"What the hell, Marie?"<br><br>"Look," she said, pointing at the wolf.<br><br>Silas turned in the direction she was indicating.<br><br>"Yes, damn it. It's a wolf and&#x2014;"<br><br>The words froze in the back of his throat. He took a deep breath and then wiped his eyes, certain he was hallucinating.<br><br>"That is not possible," Silas muttered, then turned toward Marie. "Holy Mother of God, is that a baby? Is it? Do you see it, Marie? Is that a real baby beside that wolf, or am I crazy?"<br><br>Marie muttered something in her native language, then turned around and ran.<br><br>Silas wanted to follow her, but the sight of that thin sun-browned toddler held him fast.<br><br>The wolf yipped. Once.<br><br>The gun Silas was holding slipped from his hands and landed at his feet with a thud. He stood, still staring in disbelief as the she-wolf also stopped. Separated by less than twenty yards, Silas watched as the wolf lifted her head. Even from this distance, he felt her gaze fixed on him.<br><br>"Jesus, Jesus, Jesus," he whispered as his legs went weak. He wanted to run, but he couldn't bring himself to move. Still, he had to do something. That little kid could barely walk and was frighteningly thin. He couldn't just turn away from this. Even if he didn't understand it, he couldn't let it go.<br><br>Without thinking of the danger to himself, he took a deep breath, and started waving and shouting at the wolf.<br><br>The she-wolf flinched at the sharp, frightening sounds. She felt the danger as vividly as she felt the wind on her face. It was time to go. She turned to the pup and nudged it forward. It toddled a few steps ahead of her, then stumbled and dropped into the dirt.<br><br>Every instinct she had told her to run. Now. But she was torn. The pup whined as it fell. When it began struggling to get up, her instinct was to go toward it, but then she looked up. The human was moving closer. Without looking at the pup again, she turned and began loping back toward the trees.<br><br>Left on its own, the pup began to cry in earnest.<br><br>She could hear it as she ran. But it was only after she reached relative safety at the tree line that she stopped and looked back. The place looked deserted. That was when she lifted her head and howled. The long, mournful sound spilled down into Snow Valley, then echoed off the surrounding hills.<br><br>But it was what happened next that sent the entire village of Snow Valley into shock.<br><br>Silas had the child in his arms and was heading for Doc Lawson's house as fast as he could go. He looked behind him more than once as he ran, making sure the wolf hadn't done a U-turn and nipped back on his heels. As he ran, he kept glancing down at the baby, feeling the little boy's long black hair blowing across his face and the heat emanating from his thin brown body. Silas thought the child looked Indian, but it was hard to tell how much was dirt and how much was true skin color.<br><br>Suddenly the long, mournful howl of a wolf rode the wind blowing down into the valley. The howl was disconcerting. Silas flinched as he looked over his shoulder one last time, just to assure himself that the wolf was gone.<br><br>At the sound of the wolf's howl, the baby grabbed Silas by his full, bushy beard, then twisted in his arms so that he was now looking toward the mountain. The little boy's tear-filled eyes were wide with shock. But instead of crying, he opened his little mouth and wailed. The high-pitched sound was an almost perfect echo of the wolf's howl.<br><br>Startled, Silas gasped and came close to dropping the child. If the boy had not been holding on to Silas's beard with both hands, he would have gone tumbling down to the ground. But Silas quickly recovered and began patting the baby on the back, trying to give him comfort as he kept on going.<br><br>"Now, now," Silas muttered. "Don't cry, little fella, don't cry."<br><br>The sound of Silas's voice was as startling to the baby as the wolf's howl had been to Silas. For a few silent moments, their gazes locked.<br><br>It was then that Silas realized the baby's eyes were not brown, but amber, marked with flecks of a yellowish gold, more like the eyes of the wolf instead of the dark-eyed Inuits.<br><br>"Damn, kid...where did you come from?" But the wolf couldn't talk and the child didn't know.<br><br></p><h2>Mrs. Jeffries Pinches the Post</h2><p><b>A Mrs. Jeffries Mystery</b><br><br> <i>She keeps house for Inspector Witherspoon...and keeps him on his toes.

There simply was no doubt about it: John Hancock was the least likely man in Boston to start a rebellion. How, then, did this Tory patrician become one of the staunchest supporters of the American Revolution?<br><br>John Hancock's overnight transformation from British loyalist to fiery rebel and first governor of the independent state of Massachusetts is one of the least known but most gripping stories of the American Revolution. Now, acclaimed author Harlow Giles Unger introduces us to the Founding Father whose name is as recognizable as George Washington's, but whose thrilling life story is all but untold. Applying his historical expertise and storytelling gift, Unger details the fascinating life of one of our most extraordinary business and political leaders--the first signer of the Declaration of Independence.<br><br>As Unger reveals in this unflinching portrait, Hancock was one of the most paradoxical figures of his time. Arguably the wealthiest man in the American colonies, he unabashedly reveled in his riches, adoring all the foppish trappings he could buy. But his commitment to the individual liberty eventually transformed him into a fervent revolutionary, venerated equally by his establishment peers at Harvard as he was by the rebels--the Minutemen who did the fighting and the Boston street mobs who declared him their hero even as they burned the homes of other aristocrats. To repay their respect, he sacrificed his fortune and risked death by hanging to win independence from the British. A brilliant orator, he combines his wealth and political skills to unite Boston's merchant and working classes into an armed might that forced Britain's vaunted professional army to evacuate Boston, assuring the success of the Revolution.</p><p>PRAISE FOR HARLOW Giles UNGER&#x2019;S NOAH WEBSTER: THE LIFE AND TIMES OF AN AMERICAN PATRIOT<p>"Noah Webster was a truly remarkable man; shrewd, passionate, learned and energetic, God-fearing and patriotic.

He made his way through the long island chain of the West Indies by steamer, aeroplane and sailing ship, noting in his records of the voyage the minute details of daily life, of the natural surroundings and of the idiosyncratic and distinct civilisations he encountered amongst the Caribbean Islands. From the ghostly Ciboneys and the dying Caribs to the religious eccentricities like the Kingston Pocomaniacs and the Poor Whites in the Islands of the Saints, Patrick Leigh Fermor recreates a vivid world, rich and vigorous with life.</p><p>After his famous walk across Europe - recounted in A Time of Gifts and Between the Woods and the Water - Patrick Leigh Fermor lived and travelled in the Balkans and the Greek Archipelago. In the Second World War he joined the Irish Guards, became a liaison officer in Albania and fought in Greece and Crete - living disguised as a shepherd in the mountains for two years organising resistance activities. He was awarded the DSO and CBE, and a knighthood in the 2004 new Year Honours List.The Caribbean as Fermor experienced it in the 1940's was a world of incredible fusions and contradictions that didn't exist anywhere else in the world - the mix of indigenous, African and European cultures, the juxtaposition of American advertisements with ancient cannibal practices, the incredible richness of the natural environment coupled with the decaying state of the colonial cities. <p>Although Fermor had travelled extensively, he found the West Indies to be unlike anything he could have imagined, and each new experience is a surprise. This book is a pleasure to read, full of excitement and rich sensory experience, as well as beautifully written. Fermor's first view of the islands demonstrates the elegance of his language: </p><p>"To port, pale green islands were floating on the water, but the main body of Grande Terre...lay in shadow on the starboard side between us and the dawn. It was just possible to descry the waves of black vegetation and the lakes of mist entangled in the treetops where the country dipped. In the space of a few minutes the sunrise melted from violet into amber, from amber into scarlet, from scarlet into zinc and from zinc into saffron. The dark vegetation became a line of giant, pale green parsley, which hovered a hundred yards away in a fluttering cumulus that nothing appeared to tether to either land or sea." </p><p>Language, religion, costume, geography - the author inquires into everything, and because of this natural curiosity, he gets himself into some interesting, and often funny, situations, like being chased around the beach by a blindfolded man with a divining rod. Equally interesting, though, are his descriptions of the specific melding of cultures that has occurred exclusively in these islands: </p><p>"The afternoon was baking and shadowless, and the town seemed only with an effort to remain upright among its thoroughfares of dust. It was as empty as a sarcophagus. The French guide-book describes it as a great centre of elegant Creole life in the past, hinting at routs and cavalcades and banquets of unparalleled sumptuousness. Acts of God must have fallen upon it with really purposeful vindictiveness, for not by the most violent manhandling of the imagination could one associate a chandelier or a powdered wig with this collection of hovels. Not even a dog was to be seen. But behind a tall crucifix stood a cemetery of such dimensions - Pere Lachaise and the Campo Santo gone mad...These acres inhabited by the dead, these miniature hails and palaces and opera-houses, were, it occurred to me, the real town, and the houses falling to ruins outside the railings were in the nature of a negligible suburb." </p><p>He is generally respectful of the cultures he encounters, and describes the dining habits of cannibals without batting an eyelash: </p><p>"The victims were prepared while still alive, by cutting slits down the back and sides into which pimentos and other herbs were stuffed. After being dispatched with a mace, they were trussed to poles and roasted over a medium fire, while the women busied themselves turning and basting, and catching the lard in gourds and calabashes, which they allowed to set and then stored away. They would eagerly lick the sticks where the gravy had fallen. Often the meal was half roasted, and then half boiled. Some of the meat was eaten on the spot, the rest was cut up and smoked and also prudently put by for lean or unpatriotic periods in the future. But there was a symbolical aspect to these banquets. They were considered to seal a military victory, to put it for ever beyond question. De Rochefort reports that a Carib prisoner, while being made ready, would jeer at his captors, saying that, although they would soon be eating him, he had already swallowed so many of their family or tribe, and was so thoroughly nourished on their neighbours and kin, that they would virtually be eating one of their own people. This kind of language would continue until the final blow was delivered. It never failed to exasperate the company, and to cast an atmosphere of dejection over the whole meal." </p><p>That is the beauty of this narrative - it is just one tasty morsel after another.</p></p><h2>Roman Britain: Life at the Edge of Empire</h2><p>The British Museum&#39;s new introductory guide to Roman Britain combines an informative text with first-class design and is illustrated with plentiful artefacts from the museum&#39;s collections. Throughout the book the emphasis is on cultural interaction and change, showing the impact of the Roman presence, but also British survivals; the book starts, perhaps unusually for general guides of this kind, with a section on pre-Roman Britain, and ends with a chapter on Britons after Rome. In between we learn about the military, the new literate culture introduced by Rome, about the impact of Rome on the rural economy, and on life in the new towns, as well as about religion. Constant reference to archaeological finds and sites gives a sense of place, and also of regional variation.</p><p>Richard Hobbs is curator of the Romano-British collection at the British Museum.

This book contains his one pre-Gateway Heechee story, the novella "The Merchants of Venus," and nine short entries under such titles as "The Gateway Asteroid," "The Starseekers" and "Other Worlds" that provide background on the characters and settings of the Heechee novels. The narrator of the novella , Audee Walthers, makes his living on Venus by showing tourists around the Heechee ruins, abandoned 500,000 years earlier. He hopes that wealthy, surly Boyce Cochenour will pay him enough to provide for surgery to replace his failing liver. There's only one problem, an ethical one: Cochenour wants to dig for illegal artifacts. The story has the zip and humor of vintage Pohl. The short pieces that comprise the rest of the volume are not narratives but glossings on the Heechee novels. Although Pohl is careful not to give away plot elements of those books, at the same time he presents new details to enhance that universe for familiar readers. Still, it would be preferable to read the novels first.

They find themselves walking the streets of Paris and talking late into the night. What follows is an unusual friendship of eccentric correspondence and long walks around the city. <br><br>M. is working on a new novel set in Turkey and Nunu tells him about her family, hoping to impress and inspire him. She recounts the idyllic landscapes of her past, mythical family meals, and her elaborate childhood games.

Their intimacy deepens, so does Nunu's fear of revealing too much to M. and of giving too much of herself and her Istanbul away. Most of all, she fears that she will have to face her own guilt about her mother and the narratives she's told to protect herself from her memories.<br><br>A wise and unguarded glimpse into a young woman's coming into her own, <i>Walking on the Ceiling</i> is about memory, the pleasure of invention, and those places, real and imagined, we can't escape.</p><p><b>Ay&#x15f;eg�l Sava&#x15f;</b> grew up in Turkey and Denmark.

He was a foreigner to the city, too, which may have been one reason for our friendship. We went on walks around the city and we wrote to each other.<br>What remains of that time is a photograph of M. standing in front of a marble wall, looking at me with bewildered eyes. Above his raised eyebrow, a pale and jagged scar rises, deepens, disappears.<br>Actually, this may not be a scar at all, but a trick of the shadows, or the author's face folded with age. I do not recall a scar from our walks, but I often walked alongside him with my head down. And I'm not sure whether his eyes are really cast up in surprise, as I said, and not simply with impatience at having his photo taken.<br>Still, I remember M. as always a bit bewildered, and with the scar on his eyebrow-a sign illuminated in that brief moment of documentation when he looked me straight in the eyes.<br>But here, too, my account is faulty, since between my eyes and his stood the comforting length of the camera lens. As far as I can remember, I never looked M. in the eyes, even when we were seated across from each other at a caf�.<br>Some days, it's difficult to believe that this friendship really existed-with its particular logic, its detachment from the world. What I remember has the texture of a dream, an invention, a strange and weightless suspension, like walking on the ceiling.<br>In my childhood, I would hold a square mirror up to the ceiling. I examined every inch of this flat, white expanse, entirely removed from the jagged world on the opposite pole where people lived in shadows, weighed down by troubles. I understood that all anyone can do in the midst of darkness is retreat to their own, bright landscapes.</p><p>I think more and more these days that I should set down some of the facts of my friendship with M., to keep something of this time intact. But stories are reckless things, blind to everything but their own shape. When you tell a story, you set out to leave so much behind. And I have to admit that there is no shape in those long walks and conversations, even if I think of them often.<br>Let me place the photograph here, as the tangible remains of our friendship.<br>What follows is an incomplete inventory.</p><p>2.</p><p>I met M. some months after I moved to Paris from Istanbul. I arrived in the city without a job or a place to live. I was enrolled in a literature program in order to obtain a visa, but I knew even before I came that I would not attend any of the classes.<br>I had enrolled in the same program once before, a few years after I graduated from university in England. I had a different vision of myself then, and I worked steadily to achieve it. I was living in London with my boyfriend, Luke, and putting together my life piece by piece. I imagined that Luke and I would move to Paris, become its natives, and lead the kind of creative life attributed to the residents of the city. We even spoke to each other in French while we cooked dinner, in preparation for our new life.<br>On the phone, my mother had urged me to go to Paris. I hadn't been back to Istanbul for several years and she always found a way to make this sound natural.<br>"Of course you should go, Nunu," she said. "What's there for you in Istanbul, anyway?"<br>I hadn't proposed returning home as an alternative.<br>It wasn't from my mother but from her aunts that I found out she was sick. I went back to Istanbul soon after this, canceling my Paris plans.<br>The second time I decided to go to Paris, my mother's aunts, Asuman and Saniye, warned me that it was foolish to live a life without roots. It was the type of thing they might have told my mother as well, the type of thing that would have made her silent. The aunts said I should be wise and build myself a life in Istanbul, as if building a life were a matter of simple engineering, as I, too, used to believe. A steady job, an easy commute, a reliable husband.<br>"Your poor mother never managed," the aunts said.<br>To build my life, I should have them nearby to make sure everything was done the right way. They wouldn't allow anyone to think that I led the drifting life of an orphan. When the time came, they would arrange for wedding presents, bed linens, tablecloths, dinners.<br>They even offered to help renovate my mother's apartment.<br>"We can make it just the way you want," they said, and told me about their plans. We would paint my mother's bedroom and change all the furniture. We would move my bedroom to my mother's study, where she had kept all my father's books. Once we took down the bookshelves, they assured me, the room would actually be very spacious.<br>My childhood bedroom would serve as a guest room for now.<br>"And later," Saniye said, "who knows."<br>They also said, on the afternoon when we went to the notary to finalize the sale of the apartment, that it was a waste. I had already told them I would use some of the money to go to Paris and pay for the program and my living expenses.<br>They said it again after I signed the papers. "What a waste. Your poor mother's home."<br>This was a name they gave her afterwards-my poor mother.</p><p>3.</p><p>In Paris, I moved into a studio apartment close to the Gare du Nord train station, where frequent arrivals and departures gathered and dispersed people at every moment like a beating heart. I liked to think that I could board a train and leave the city anytime I wanted. The neighborhood disassembled itself and came back together several times a day and was an entirely different place at night. I did not feel in those first weeks that I was living in the city, but in the residues of many places.<br>I was renting the studio from a man who owned the Caf&#x17d; du Coin at the entrance to the building. After our brief meeting at the caf&#x17d;, he carried my single suitcase up the uneven wooden stairs and unlocked the door.<br>"If you need anything . . . ," he said at the threshold. Then he seemed to change his mind and went back downstairs.<br>My room was bare but not neat, as if someone had moved out and left behind belongings no longer needed in their new life. There was a mattress, a square table, a stove with a kettle, and four mismatched chairs. I had brought photographs, a small vase, and two porcelain statues from Istanbul and I put them around the room for decoration when I arrived. They seemed tiny and pathetic, and after several days, I put them back into my suitcase.<br>From my window, I saw a new pile of abandoned furniture on the sidewalk each day, for a municipal truck to pick up. Men in long and colorful tunic shirts would stop by to examine the pieces before walking up the road to congregate around the station to watch the new arrivals to the city.<br>In the afternoons, I walked down to boulevard de S&#x17d;bastopol, where I stopped at a grocery store called Istanbul-Grill-Foods to buy a pack of roasted chickpeas. I followed the boulevard south, to the Seine, with the thought that I would walk to the neighborhoods of the Left Bank, or along the river to the gilded monuments-all the places that appeared in postcards of Paris and defined the city for those who didn't live there. But when I reached the river, I felt overwhelmed by the thought of everything that lay ahead.<br>One evening, I stood watching the brown water, panic rising up my throat. I found a bench and sat down, and I thought that I would not be able to get back home because I was so tired. After a while, I got up and started walking slowly, recovering my energy. By the time I approached my neighborhood and could see the turn to my street, I was thinking that I should have walked farther, and told myself that I would explore more the following day.<br>Some days, I sat at the Caf� du Coin at the entrance to my building. I often came there at lunchtime, though I did not eat, just sipped coffee, and was ushered to a small table by the back wall. Even after several weeks, the young waiter did not seem to remember me. He asked for my order with impatience and always brought a different size coffee than I had ordered. The caf� regulars ate copious salads piled with meats, or a tagine served with pickles and dried fruits. Some days they had a glass of beer, other times they ended their meals with dessert. I was struck by how appropriate their choices seemed. How they managed to pick the most fitting dish for that hour of that particular day. I wondered how it was that people knew what to do. Small things, I mean. The rituals of a day. The hours.<br>After the waiter cleared the regulars' plates, he brought them coffee and joined them outside for a cigarette. But first he would come to my table and tap twice, meaning that he wanted to settle my bill. I sat for a few more minutes, then gulped the remains of my cup, left some coins on the table, and climbed the stairs back up to my room.<br><br>There is a scene in one of M.'s novels, set in Istanbul. I read it when I came back to take care of my mother, and read that scene again when I moved to Paris. I already knew, in those first weeks, that M. lived in Paris as well, and this seemed strange to me. I couldn't imagine him anywhere other than Istanbul, in the landscape of his lonely characters.<br>In the scene, an old man walks past a bakery one evening, around sunset. It is the month of Ramadan and the bakery has a line of people waiting to buy bread before joining their families for dinner. (I forgave M. this clich� of writing about Istanbul on a Ramadan evening.) There is a long description of desserts filling up shop windows as the time for breaking fast approaches. For a second, M. seems to forget about his character and indulges in a description of mounds of shaved pistachio, rose-scented dough, and buttery pastries, like jewels that decorate the windows. It's just like him to turn away like this, to give in to the temptation of a feast in his writing. But the sentence that follows has remained with me ever since:<br>Seeing all the people standing in the bakery line with purpose, the old man feels embarrassed and turns away from the steaming stacks of bread on the counter.<br>When I first read this, I thought that the old man was embarrassed of the bread itself, and not just the people at the bakery, and I remembered this description when I came home from my walks, those first weeks in Paris.<br>I would sit down at the kitchen table and feel the objects of the room taking note of my brief absence and prompt return, and I was embarrassed.</p><p>4.</p><p>"Shame on you," the aunts said when they called me in London to tell me that my mother was sick.<br>By this, I thought that they might mean one of two things. The first, that a daughter should know without being told about her mother's illness.<br>The second, that I had made my mother sick.<br>I realized later that the aunts were using this opportunity to tell me what they thought about my living situation-far from home and with my boyfriend, Luke, whom they hadn't met. Without a care for the world, they said. For the proper way to do things.<br>"Nejla let you run wild. And now she keeps quiet because she doesn't want to upset you," Saniye said.<br>"That's the truth. But we won't let her tiptoe around you anymore."<br>It had never occurred to me that my mother had allowed me to run wild. I would have said that all my life, I was the one who had walked on tiptoe.</p><p>5.</p><p>In Paris, there was a Dutch boy in the program I'd enrolled in. I met him the only time I went to the university, to hand in my registration forms. We exchanged phone numbers, and we both said how much we were looking forward to the semester. The Dutch boy told me he had spent all summer reading. He named book after book in an expanding web as if he were trying to sum up the world. I nodded my head at his list.<br>"You and I have so much to discuss," he added when he was done, and I agreed.<br>He sent me a text message some days later to ask why I hadn't come to the first class. I told him I was sick and asked him to send me the readings assigned for the following week.<br>He invited me to a picnic on the riverbank that weekend, on one of the islands. "A couple of us from class are meeting up while the weather's still nice. You should come and cure yourself with a celebration."<br>I walked all the way to the river, crossed to the �le Saint-Louis, and spotted the gathering from a distance. My classmates were dressed in somber, stylish colors, holding their glasses with both hands as if they were precious objects. They all had so much curiosity on their faces as they chatted and nodded, nimbly holding their drinks, that I could not even imagine what they might be talking about. It occurred to me that I hadn't brought anything for the picnic and turned back.<br>On my way home, I watched a group of rollerbladers on the Pont Saint-Louis dressed in tweed suits and bowler hats, weaving in and out of plastic cones in tune to classical music. (M. would tell me later that he did not like this bridge, because it was not part of the real city; it belonged to tourists. And the two of us always walked the adjacent Pont de la Tournelle.) One of the rollerbladers, an older man who was a bit slower than the others, tipped his hat at me as he twirled around a cone.<br>When the Dutch boy sent another text, I told him I had enjoyed the readings and I would see him soon. After that, I mostly kept my phone turned off, except for the times I called my mother's aunts.</p></p><h2>The Archer&#39;s Bible</h2><p>The Archer&#39;s Bible Paperback - June, 1980 by Fred Bear (Author)</p><p></p><h2>The Secret of the Unseen Treasure</h2><p>A stranger&#39;s attempt to burn down the greenhouse of Ethel Elliot, a poor widow, gives Trixie her first mystery of summer vacation</p><p></p><h2>Going to America</h2><p>Coleman, Terry, Going To America</p><p></p><h2>Avenger</h2><p><br>Attorney Calvin Dexter hangs his shingle in a quiet New Jersey town, has a reasonably successful practice, and takes the hills strong while triathalon training.

The Welcome Table: A Lifetime of Memories with Recipes</h2><p>Throughout Maya Angelou&#x2019;s life, from her childhood in Stamps, Arkansas, to her world travels as a bestselling writer, good food has played a central role. Preparing and enjoying homemade meals provides a sense of purpose and calm, accomplishment and connection. Now in <i>Hallelujah! The Welcome Table,</i> Angelou shares memories pithy and poignant&#x2013;and the recipes that helped to make them both indelible and irreplaceable.<br><br>Angelou tells us about the time she was expelled from school for being afraid to speak&#x2013;and her mother baked a delicious maple cake to brighten her spirits. She gives us her recipe for short ribs along with a story about a job she had as a cook at a Creole restaurant (never mind that she didn&#x2019;t know how to cook and had no idea what Creole food might entail). There was the time in London when she attended a wretched dinner party full of wretched people; but all wasn&#x2019;t lost&#x2013;she did experience her initial taste of a savory onion tart. She recounts her very first night in her new home in Sonoma, California, when she invited M. F. K. Fisher over for cassoulet, and the evening Deca Mitford roasted a chicken when she was beyond tipsy&#x2013;and created Chicken Drunkard Style. And then there was the hearty brunch Angelou made for a homesick Southerner, a meal that earned her both a job offer and a prophetic compliment: &#x201c;If you can write half as good as you can cook, you are going to be famous.&#x201d;<br><br>Maya Angelou is renowned in her wide and generous circle of friends as a marvelous chef. Her kitchen is a social center. From fried meat pies, chicken livers, and beef Wellington to caramel cake, bread pudding, and chocolate �clairs, the one hundred-plus recipes included here are all tried and true, and come from Angelou&#x2019;s heart and her home. <i>Hallelujah! The Welcome Table </i>is a stunning collaboration between the two things Angelou loves best: writing and cooking.</p><p><b>Maya Angelou</b> was raised in Stamps, Arkansas. In addition to her bestselling autobiographies, including <i>I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</i> and <i>The Heart of a Woman,</i> she wrote numerous volumes of poetry, among them <i>Phenomenal Woman, And Still I Rise, On the Pulse of Morning,</i> and <i>Mother</i>. Maya Angelou died in 2014.Chapter 1<br><br> Pie Fishing<br> My grandmother, who my brother, Bailey, and I called Momma, baked lemon meringue pie that was unimaginably good. My brother and I waited for the pie. We yearned for it, longed for it. Bailey even hinted and dropped slightly veiled suggestions about it, but none of his intimations hastened its arrival. Nor could anything he said stave off the story that came part and parcel with the pie.<br><br> Bailey would complain, "Momma, you told us that story a hundred times" or "We know what happened to the old woman" and "Momma, can we just have the pie?" (Momma always ignored his attempts to prevent her from telling the tale.) But if we wanted Momma's lemon meringue pie, we had to listen to the story:<br><br> There was an old woman who had made it very clear that she loved young men. Everyone in town knew where her interests lay so she couldn't get any local young men to come to her house. Old men had to be called to clean out her chimney or fix her roof or mend her fences. She learned to count on finding young strangers who were traveling through the area.<br><br> One Sunday morning there was a new young man in church sitting alone. Mrs. Townsend saw him and as soon as the last hymn was sung, before anyone else could reach him, she rushed over to his bench.<br><br> "Morning, I'm Hattie Townsend. What's your name?"<br><br> "George Wilson, ma'am."<br><br> She frowned a little.<br><br> "Anybody get to you?"<br><br> "No, ma'am. I don't know anyone here. Just passed by, saw the church, and stopped in." He had used the word ma'am out of courtesy.<br><br> She was all smiles again. "Well, then I'm inviting you, and I am a good cook, to my house for Sunday dinner. I have my own chickens and two cows, so my chickens are fresh and my butter is rich. I live in walking distance. Here is my address; come around this afternoon around three o'clock."<br><br> She patted him on the shoulder and left the church.<br><br> A few young men from the congregation rushed over.<br><br> "Mrs. Townsend invited you for dinner?"<br><br> "Yes."<br><br> "Well, I'm Bobby. Here's Taylor and this one is Raymond. We've all been to her house and she's a good cook."<br><br> The men started laughing.<br><br> "No, she's a great cook. It's just that after you eat, she pounces."<br><br> "Man, the lady can pounce."<br><br> The stranger said, "I don't mind a little pouncing."<br><br> They all laughed again. "But man, she's old. She's older than my mother."<br><br> "She's older than my grandmother."<br><br> "She's older than baseball."<br><br> The stranger said, "I'll eat dinner and after that I can take care of myself. Thanks, fellas, for warning me."<br><br> Bobby shouted, "Her lemon pie will make a rabbit hug a hound."<br><br> Taylor added, "Make a preacher lay his Bible down."<br><br> Meanwhile, Mrs. Townsend entered her house and went directly to her sewing box. She put on her glasses and took out a needle.<br><br> She walked back down the path to her house and stuck the needle in a tree.<br><br> She returned to the house and began to cook a chicken she had resting in the refrigerator. For the next hour she stirred pots and shifted pans, then she set her dining table for two. She had time to freshen up and change before her company came.<br><br> "Well, welcome, Mr. Wilson."<br><br> He was a little cooler than he had been at church.<br><br> She knew why but she also knew he hadn't eaten her cooking.<br><br> "The bathroom is here if you would like to freshen up. Dinner is not quite ready yet."<br><br> Of course everything was ready, but she wanted him to have time to breathe in the fine aromas floating in the air.<br><br> She served him chicken and dumplings. Chicken tender as mercy and dumplings light as summer clouds.<br><br> The side dishes were fried yellow summer squash and English peas.<br><br> He didn't care that he was eating as if he hadn't eaten in a month. She kept pressing him, "Eat some more, but save a place for dessert. Some people swear by my lemon meringue pie."<br><br> Between bites she thought she heard him mumble, "That's my favorite."<br><br> When he put his first bite of Mrs. Townsend's pie in his mouth, he was hers. He was ready to marry her or let her adopt him.<br><br> She sat opposite and watched as with each forkful he surrendered more.<br><br> After the second slice he would have followed her to the Sahara Desert.<br><br> She said, "Let's go out on the porch for the air."<br><br> He replied meekly, "Yes, ma'am."<br><br> Once they settled into the swing on the porch she said, "My goodness, night has fallen. It's quite dark."<br><br> "Yes, ma'am. It's dusk all right."<br><br> They swung a few times.<br><br> She asked, "What on earth is that shining down there in that tree?"<br><br> He squinted, "I can't hardly see a tree."<br><br> She said, "Yes, I see it. It's either a needle or a pin shining. Well, I do say. It's a needle."<br><br> He asked, "You can tell?"<br><br> She said, "Yes, I see the hole. I'll go get it."<br><br> He said, "Well, that proves you are not as old as they say you are. When you come back I may have some talk for you."<br><br> She stepped off the porch and went down the lane and retrieved the needle. When she came back she could hardly see the house, but she kept walking with her head up, triumph in her grasp.<br><br> She tripped in the darkness. After much fumbling she was able to stand erect. She saw that she had fallen over a cow that had lain down in the lane.<br><br> Mr. Wilson saw her fall, and he could see the cow. When she gave a little scream, he bounded off the porch to help her. Once she collected herself, he said, "Well, thank you for dinner. I have to go."<br><br> She asked, "Can't you stay for one more slice of pie?" The strength of the pie can be seen in the fact that he did stop to think about it.<br><br> She took his arm as if she wasn't going to give it back. He thought of the pie again and then the cow and the possible pouncing. He said, "No, ma'am," and snatched his arm and went away running. He escaped, but he never forgot the pie.<br><br> Each time, my grandmother laughed until tears flooded her cheeks. I think she knew Mrs. Townsend or someone very much like her.<br><br> Here is the recipe.

Due to the pressure of time, the work was hastily edited and contained a number of typing errors. A second improved edition was printed a few years later with some additional material from another source.

Vaughan has previously written episodes of Swamp Thing for DC and The Hood mini-series for Marvel JG Jones has created covers for Just A Pilgrim (available from Titan) and Marvel Boy and Black Widow for Marvel. He is currently working on Wonder Woman- Hiketeia.Set somewhere between <i>The West Wing </i>and an alternative future, this taleasks the question: What if the mayor of New York was a superhero? Vaughan (<i>Y: The Last Man</i>) and Harris (<i>Starman</i>) answer with intelligence and dash. In classic superhero origin, Mitchell Hundred is just another civil engineer until an encounter with a glowing light under the Brooklyn Bridge gives him the power to talk to machines. Fast forward three years: after a famed stint as a superhero, Hundred has just been elected mayor of New York and must deal with not only the colorful cast of characters that make up his staff but also a host of crises: a PR disaster set off by an exhibit at the Brooklyn Museum; a crippling blizzard; and, most worryingly, a serial killer who's bumping off the city's snow plow drivers. Vaughan cleverly adapts real news stories&#x2014;New York mayoral politics, the <i>Sensations</i> art scandal&#x2014;and plausibly fits them into a world where superheroes exist, but are forbidden by the NSA to talk about their powers, while adding surprising twists and turns. Harris's gritty, charismatic characters give the story further appeal. This vastly entertaining first collection should have readers eager to read future volumes. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Q. C. Lamar Bushrow. In each case, a chapter of a nationally important organization was involved, and in each case the nature of the crime was initially misunderstood.The second case is more remarkable than the first because, among other things, Mrs. Bushrow is now two years older than she was when she solved the DAR mystery. The DAR mystery was clarified to some degree by coincidence, but the Rotary mystery was explained largely through logical processes backed up by patient detective work on the part of Mrs. Bushrow.By all that is right and proper, I ought not to have anything to do with the telling of this story, but Mrs. Bushrow, who furnished the public such a charming account of her activities in <i>The Famous DAR Murder Mystery,</i> absolutely refused to put pen to paper unless I agreed to referee the book in somewhat the same way that Mrs. Parsons presided over the DAR account.I am, of course, happy to accede to Mrs. Bushrow's request, for two reasons. On the one hand, her refusal to record her activities in this case would deprive the public of the pleasure of continued acquaintance with her. And on the other, my personality as my wife depicted it in the former book was not altogether as I would like the public to think of me. You will find that a wife's-eye view of a husband is often skewed, and I suppose that the observation of character at the close range of marriage can blur the image in the same way that the observation of a painting at too short a distance can interfere with our impression of the picture as a whole. Let us hope that I am not nearly so sententious as I appear from the references Helen--i.e., my wife--made to me in her share of <i>The Famous DAR Murder Mystery.</i>As Professor Landrum pointed out in the preface to that book, the crime described had already taken place before the story began. Such was essentially the case with the murder presently under consideration. It occurred at the Borderville Motor Inn, universally referred to by Bordervillians as "the Inn," on May 26 or 27 last, at some time between 11:30 P.M. Monday and 2:00 A.M. Tuesday. But we were unaware of the fact until a little after noon on Tuesday.Tuesday is Rotary day in Borderville. Helen calls it Sacred Tuesday because she says Rotarians are far more conscientious about Rotary than they are about church. She may be right about that; but as far as our club goes, we are neither very holy about church nor very careful about the attendance rules of Rotary. Our club, to our shame, has an attendance average of about 67 percent, for which we are constantly being chided by our sergeant at arms.Nevertheless, there are some of us who are markedly constant in attendance, and I suppose I am one of them. I rarely miss unless I am out of town. I should, of course, make up my absence by attending another club, but it is often inconvenient or impossible to do so. The fact that I always attend when I amhere in Borderville is due not to the excellence of the food or the interest stimulated by the programs, neither of which would be worth the quarterly dues of the club, but to my pleasure in the association I have with four men, who nearly always sit with me at the same table, up front, just to the left of the speaker.Sitting there at the same table week after week is hardly in line with the ideals of the organization. But for those of us who are fifty and up, it is very pleasant to luxuriate in a familiar groove (a word of excellent connotation in my youth); and we, as "old boys," enjoy our own rather predictable conversation. Since there are six chairs at each table, we do not feel that we are exclusive, for anyone who wishes to sit with us is cordially welcomed to do so.But the four regulars with whom I always eat are Trajan McDowell, Steve Johnson, Raymond Rogers, and Dr. Fred Middleton. We usually try to get to the Borderville Inn at five or ten minutes of twelve in order to pick up our food from the steam table and be seated before the rest of the club has arrived. By that means, we get the waitress to come directly to our table and thereby fill our cups immediately. Then, when she had poured coffee for all the rest, she comes back to us so that we always have coffee at hand to enjoy as we listen to the day's speaker.Which is very important. That is to say, the coffee is very important.Also important is the fact that the four men whom I have mentioned are all Presbyterians, three of them being elders in the First Presbyterian Church and the other a deacon in the Second Presbyterian Church. As the son of a Presbyterian minister, I joined the Episcopal church when I married, but there's something about being with men who grew up the way I did that is like going home. Whatever the reason for it, we form a very congenial group.On that Tuesday, as usual, I arrived at the Inn about ten minutes before the appointed time. Because it had beenannounced that the district governor was going to speak to us, there were already quite a few Rotarians present.Rotary district governors are in some ways pretty much the same. They are jolly men and always supportive, optimistic, and entirely sold on Rotary. They would have to be of that sort in order to spend the time, effort, and money required of a district governor. You see, a district governor, in addition to other duties, must visit each club in his district at least once a year. The result is that for a whole year, a district governor is called away from his business repeatedly; and unless he is retired or reasonably well fixed financially, there is an element of sacrifice in the governorship that a good many Rotarians would find difficult to afford. District governors, therefore, are on the whole financially successful as well as superior in other regards.Do not think, however, that we look forward to the district governor's visit with enthusiasm. What the poor man has to say to us is pretty much what the former district governor said to us on a similar occasion the year before. The governor will always recite the praises of Rotary International, and these are certainly impressive. But when you have heard them for a quarter of a century, your mind is likely to wander somewhere between the Four-Way Test and the Paul Harris Fellowship. On the other hand, the district governor usually has three or four pretty good jokes.But a local club, especially one like ours, which doesn't have a good attendance record, always tries to get all its members out for the district governor's visit. For a whole month before the event, the sergeant at arms reminds us of the impending honor, and our president assures us that we would not wish to be absent on such an important occasion. All in all, there is a great deal more bustle than usual about the meeting when the district governor is to be present.As I say, I got to the Borderville Inn ten minutes early. Mabel Mahaffey was setting up her music on the spinet piano in the corner behind the flag. Joseph D. (Jody) Russell, our secretary-treasurer,was buzzing about doing the things he does. Warren Perkins was hanging the Rotary banners, four of them, on the wall behind the lectern. It was our typical, cheerful confusion.Steve Johnson was already at the table. We had roast pork in honor of the district governor, and I noticed that Steve had helped himself rather generously to the meat. Then Trajan came in, got his plate, and sat down. Just about the time that Mrs. Mahaffey began to play, Raymond came in.Steve began to tell us about some trouble the congregation at Second Presbyterian is having with its minister.By that time, the room was pretty full and the noise level was so high that we could hardly hear Mrs. Mahaffey tinkling away at "Time on My Hands." The younger Rotarians don't care for the old songs, but the older fellows crave something they know--something that has a tune.Ray has a new boat and told us about the fish he had caught on the preceding weekend. Steve wanted to know when Ray was going to take the rest of us out on the lake. And there was other chatter of the same sort, all inconsequential and very much the same conversation we had heard every Tuesday for twenty-odd years.I looked down at my watch. It was 12:15. I realized that our president, Eugene Spencer, had been coming in and out and stirring around in a generally nervous way. But I supposed the district governor was getting to town a little later than expected.Steve Johnson turned to Tom Shaefer at the next table and said, "The governor must have had trouble on that detour on Four twenty-one.""Oh, the governor got in last night," Tom said. "He's staying here at the inn."With that settled, we went on swapping stories and making comments for another ten minutes, when suddenly Eugene rushed in, his face very serious and white. He went immediately to the podium and, grasping the microphone, said, "Fellow Rotarians, something terrible has happened to the districtgovernor. I have just been in his room. The police are here, and the sheriff is expected any minute. We will dispense with the program today. Go on eating."Then he turned to Joe and added, "Take over for me, will you? I've got to go back over there. And you might get Art Stoneman to dismiss the club at the end with a prayer."Silence fell on us. What were we to think? If the police and the sheriff were involved, was it murder?From the back of the room, Keith Duncan--it would be Keith!--called out, "Come on, Gene, give. What happened?"We all found our tongues at once."Yeah, tell us.""What happened, Gene?""Come on, tell us."And so on."I'd rather not just now," Gene answered. He was already halfway to the door. "Maybe later." And with that, he was gone.Three or four of the men got up and followed. But the rest of us returned to our roast pork and bread pudding. The reverence soon wore off, and we were saying things like "Would you call this 'dead on arrival'?" and "We've had deadly district governors, but this is the first one who was actually dead."Dreadful things to say--just dreadful!And then Fred Middleton came in. He had most of the answers to what we wanted to know.I therefore turn the story over to him.THE ROTARY CLUB MURDER MYSTERY. Copyright � 1993 by Graham Landrum. All rights reserved.

For information, address St. Martin's Press, 175 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10010.A return outing for 80-ish southern grande dame Harriet Bushrow, a major participant in solving the author's first--The Famous DAR Murder Mystery. Here, the Rotary Club's district governor Charles Hollonbrook--now in Harriet's town of Borderville, Virginia, to address local members--is found shot to death by his own gun in his locked-from-the-inside motel room. Club members, unconvinced by the police report of suicide, assign Harriet to look further. This she does with a will, driving her ancient De Soto to Hollonbrook's hometown of Stedbury, where her old friend Maud Bradfield gives her plenty of leads--to Hollonbrook's first wife Linda and their feckless son Jimmy; his second wife Alice; current mistress Kim and others in between; his once-thriving real-estate business and his basement gun range. When a car bomb destroys the De Soto in front of Maud's house, Harriet knows she's on the right track--it only remains to make the right connections. The southern charm remains, but the lack of tension, slow pace, and overplotting make for a respectable but less than compelling second outing. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Grant&#x2019;s decision, in the middle of the Civil War, to order the expulsion of all Jews from the territory under his command, and the reverberations of that decision on Grant&#x2019;s political career, on the nascent American Jewish community, and on the American political process.<br>&nbsp;<br>On December 17, 1862, just weeks before Abraham Lincoln announced the Emancipation Proclamation, General Grant issued what remains the most notorious anti-Jewish order by a government official in American history. His attempt to eliminate black marketeers by targeting for expulsion all Jews &#x201c;as a class&#x201d; unleashed a firestorm of controversy that made newspaper headlines and terrified and enraged the approximately 150,000 Jews then living in the United States, who feared the importation of European antisemitism onto American soil. <br>&nbsp;<br>Although the order was quickly rescinded by a horrified Abraham Lincoln, the scandal came back to haunt Grant when he ran for president in 1868. Never before had Jews become an issue in a presidential contest, and never before had they been confronted so publicly with the question of how to balance their &#x201c;American&#x201d; and &#x201c;Jewish&#x201d; interests. Award-winning historian Jonathan D. Sarna gives us the first complete account of this little-known episode&#x2014;including Grant&#x2019;s subsequent apology, his groundbreaking appointment of Jews to prominent positions in his administration, and his unprecedented visit to the land of Israel.

Born in the town of Rawitsch, then part of Prussia, he, like tens of thousands of other young Jews in the 1850s, had left home and endured a long, perilous voyage across the Atlantic in hopes of establishing himself in business in the United States. Opportunities in Prussia were circumscribed for Jews, owing to domestic unrest, a failing economy, and severe legal limitations on where they could live and what kinds of occupations they could pursue. America, Kaskel had heard, was different. Dispatches in the German-Jewish press and letters received from earlier immigrants reported that in America opportunity was unlimited and freedom guaranteed to people of all faiths&#x2014;Jews included. That guarantee, Kaskel now feared, had been voided.<br>&nbsp;<br>Moving to Paducah, Kentucky, in 1858, Kaskel imagined he had found just the opportunity he had been looking for. The newly incorporated city, located on the Ohio River below the mouth of the Tennessee River and fifty miles up from the Mississippi, was booming. Its population grew exponentially, reaching almost five thousand residents by the Civil War. A timely investment by city fathers in the stock of the New Orleans and Ohio Railway brought Paducah excellent rail connections and a growing volume of trade. Kaskel and his business partner, merchant Solomon Greenbaum, looked to participate in this prodigious growth. They set themselves up in business.<br>&nbsp;<br>Two years later, in 1860, a Kentucky native son, Abraham Lincoln, was elected the sixteenth president of the United States. Fewer than 1 percent of Kentucky voters supported him. Fearing that the new president and his party threatened slavery and the distinctive character of life in the South, seven Southern states, led by South Carolina, seceded to form the Confederate States of America. When the Confederacy bombarded the coastal fortification of Fort Sumter at the entrance to Charleston harbor on April 12, 1861, forcing it to surrender, war broke out. Once President Lincoln called for troops to quell the rebellion, four more states, including Virginia, joined the Confederacy, while four states on the border between the North and the South, including Kentucky, did not.<br>&nbsp;<br>The Civil War disrupted economic life in Paducah and changed Kaskel&#x2019;s life for the worse. The North began restricting Southern trade with Paducah as early as June 12, 1861, seeking to place economic pressure on the Confederacy. On September 6, Ulysses S. Grant and his troops captured and occupied the city, further restricting its trade with the South. The state of Kentucky declared itself neutral in the war, but Grant believed that the majority of Paducah&#x2019;s citizens &#x201c;would have much preferred the presence of the other army.&#x201d; Be that as it may, at least some of the city&#x2019;s thirty-odd Jews publicly supported the Union&#x2019;s cause. Cesar Kaskel was one of them; he served as vice president of the Paducah Union League Club. His younger brother, Julius, operated as a recruiter for the Union army.<br>&nbsp;<br>The disruption of free trade in Paducah created bountiful opportunities for speculators and smugglers, who always find ways to profit from wartime shortages and imbalances between supply and demand. While merchants like Kaskel burnished their pro-Union credentials in hopes of obtaining precious trade permits, officials entrusted with governing trade in and out of the city found backhanded ways to line their own pockets; so did many soldiers. In short order, public corruption rose, mutual trust declined, and recriminations abounded. As is so often the case in such circumstances, suspicion fell particularly upon the Jews, long stereotyped in Christian culture as being financially unscrupulous. Jews became the focus for much of the hatred and mistrust that the war unleashed within the city. Even though few in number in Paducah, they played an outsized role in business and trade, and as immigrants they were easily marked by their European accents and foreign ways. Unionists and Confederates alike doubted their loyalties&#x2014;partly because they doubted the loyalty of all Jews and partly because Jews nationwide were known to be on both sides of the struggle. Many therefore assumed, even in the absence of supporting evidence, that &#x201c;secessionists and Jews&#x201d; were engaged in &#x201c;rascally conduct&#x201d; in Paducah and that widespread smuggling was carried out &#x201c;as usual chiefly by Jews.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Tense as conditions were in Paducah, nothing had prepared Cesar Kaskel for the events of December 28, 1862, and his agitated response to them was understandable. Pursuing his business, in his words, as a &#x201c;peaceable, law abiding citizen,&#x201d; he was suddenly summoned, on a Sunday, to report &#x201c;immediately&#x201d; to Paducah&#x2019;s provost marshal, Captain L. J. Waddell. There he was handed the following order banishing him from the city:<br>&nbsp;<br>OFFICE OF PROVOST MARSHAL<br><i>Paducah, Ky., December 28, 1862</i><br>&nbsp;<br>C. J. Kaskel&#x2014;Sir: In pursuance of General Order No 11, issued from General Grant&#x2019;s headquarters, you are hereby ordered to leave the city of Paducah, Kentucky, within twenty-four hours after receiving this order.<br>&nbsp;<br>By order,<br>L. J. WADDELL,<br><i>Captain and Provost Marshal</i><br>&nbsp;<br>Kaskel was not the only person ordered to leave. As he heatedly informed the newspapers, anyone &#x201c;born of Jewish parents&#x201d; was likewise expelled: &#x201c;nearly thirty other gentlemen, mostly married, all respectable men, and old residents of Paducah, two of whom have served their country .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and all loyal to the Government.&#x201d; Women and children were expelled too, and in the confusion&#x2014;so it was recalled years later&#x2014;one baby was almost forgotten, and two dying women had to be left behind in the care of neighbors. Historian John E. L. Robertson preserves a (dubious) local tradition that citizens of Paducah hid some Jews to prevent their being sent away. &#x201c;One soldier,&#x201d; he reports, &#x201c;is said to have knocked on the door of a Jew and demanded, &#x2018;What are you?&#x2019; The resident of the house answered truthfully, &#x2018;Tailor.&#x2019; To which the none-too-bright soldier replied, &#x2018;Sorry to bother you, Mr. Taylor, but I&#x2019;m looking for Jews.&#x2019; &#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Cesar Kaskel quickly came to understand that Captain Waddell, in expelling him from his home, was simply following orders. The decision to evict Jews from the vast war zone under the command of General Ulysses S. Grant&#x2014;known as the &#x201c;Department of the Tennessee,&#x201d; but actually stretching from northern Mississippi to Cairo, Illinois, and from the Mississippi River to the Tennessee River&#x2014;appeared in a document entitled &#x201c;General Orders No. 11&#x201d; issued under Grant&#x2019;s own signature eleven days earlier, on December 17. Waddell handed Kaskel a copy of Grant&#x2019;s scarcely-to-be-believed order, and he wisely preserved it. Subsequently described as &#x201c;the most sweeping anti-Jewish regulation in all American history,&#x201d; it read as follows:<br>&nbsp;<br>GENERAL ORDERS No. 11, <i>Hdqrs. 13th A.C. Dept. of the Tenn.,</i> <br><i>Holly Springs, December</i> <i>17</i>,<i> 1862</i>.<br>&nbsp;<br>The Jews, as a class violating every regulation of trade established by the Treasury Department and also department orders, are hereby expelled from the department within twenty-four hours from the receipt of this order.<br>&nbsp;<br>Post commanders will see that all of this class of people be furnished passes and required to leave, and any one returning after such notification will be arrested and held in confinement until an opportunity occurs of sending them out as prisoners, unless furnished with permit from headquarters.<br>&nbsp;<br>No passes will be given these people to visit headquarters for the purpose of making personal application for trade permits.<br>&nbsp;<br>By order of Maj. Gen. U. S. Grant:<br>JNO. A. RAWLINS,<br><i>Assistant Adjutant-General.</i><br>&nbsp;<br>Kaskel instantly decided to fight the order expelling him from his home. His faith in America, after all, hung in the balance. There was, however, nobody of authority in Paducah with whom to fight. Nor, even had he tried, could he have appealed to General Grant. Less than seventy-two hours after issuing General Orders No. 11, Grant&#x2019;s forces at Holly Springs had been surprised by thirty-five hundred Confederate raiders led by Major General Earl Van Dorn. Since Grant himself was far from the scene, and the commanding officer, Robert C. Murphy, was &#x201c;out at some entertainment&#x201d; that made him, in the delicate words of a contemporary journalist, &#x201c;a trifle over bold,&#x201d; the results proved devastating: &#x201c;Holly Springs was surrounded by rebel cavalry and surrendered without resistance; over a million rations burned, several hundred bales of cotton destroyed .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and 2,000 troops [captured].&#x201d; Simultaneous raids to the north by troops of the dreaded Confederate cavalryman General Nathan Bedford Forrest inflicted significant damage and tore up fifty miles of railroad and telegraph lines.<br>&nbsp;<br>Communications between Grant&#x2019;s headquarters and the military command were disrupted for weeks by these surprise attacks. As a result, news of Grant&#x2019;s order expelling the Jews spread slowly and did not reach army headquarters in a timely fashion&#x2014;sparing many Jews who might otherwise have been banished. Nor did remonstrations against the order reach Grant. To overturn General Orders No. 11, Kaskel would have to appeal to superiors in Washington.<br>&nbsp;<br>Following time-tested traditions of Jewish politics, Kaskel began by appealing to the highest governmental power available. Long experience with persecution had persuaded Jews &#x201c;that their ultimate safety and welfare could be entrusted neither to the erratic benevolence of their gentile neighbors nor to the caprice of local authorities.&#x201d; Kaskel appealed instead to the president of the United States. Within just a few hours of being served with the order of expulsion, and without any known assistance from leading Jews of the time, Kaskel, his brother Julius, merchant Daniel Wolff, and Wolff&#x2019;s two brothers, Marcus and Alexander, dispatched a joint telegram to Abraham Lincoln at the White House. In it, they briefly set forth the terms of General Orders No. 11, described themselves as &#x201c;good and loyal citizens of the United States,&#x201d; and pronounced themselves&#x2014;as Americans&#x2014;&#x201c;greatly insulted and outraged by this inhuman order, the carrying out of which would be the grossest violation of the Constitution, and our rights as good citizens under it.&#x201d; They pointed to the larger implications of Grant&#x2019;s order, which, if allowed to stand, would stigmatize Jews &#x201c;as outlaws before the whole world.&#x201d; They appealed to Lincoln for his &#x201c;immediate attention to this enormous outrage on all law and humanity&#x201d; and asked for his &#x201c;effectual and immediate interposition.&#x201d; With their own imminent deportation uppermost in their minds, they requested, in the final sentence of their costly telegram, that &#x201c;immediate instructions .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. be sent to the commander of this post.&#x201d; Three times in three sentences they repeated the word &#x201c;immediate.&#x201d; They were desperate.<br>&nbsp;<br>Lincoln, in all likelihood, never saw this telegram. He was busy preparing to issue the Emancipation Proclamation (January 1, 1863), freeing Confederate-held slaves as &#x201c;an act of justice, warranted by the Constitution.&#x201d; The irony of his freeing the slaves while Grant was expelling the Jews was not lost on some contemporaries. The <i>Memphis Daily Bulletin</i> published the two documents, one above the other. The juxtaposition of these events, as we shall see, also shaped the responses of several Jewish leaders to Grant&#x2019;s order. They feared that Jews would replace Blacks as the nation&#x2019;s stigmatized minority. But on December 31, when the telegram was read by General-in-Chief Henry Halleck, all of this was far from anybody&#x2019;s mind. Not being familiar with Kaskel, and having no knowledge of the events that the telegram described, Halleck, with characteristic caution, sought to obtain more information. &#x201c;Respectfully referred to Gen[era]l Grant for report,&#x201d; he noted in his endorsement. By the time Grant reported, two weeks later, the order had been discussed in the halls of Congress.<br>&nbsp;<br>Kaskel, in the meanwhile, did not wait patiently. His telegram to Lincoln unanswered, he climbed aboard the steamship <i>Charley Bowen,</i> which would carry him and other Jews out of Grant&#x2019;s department, and hastily penned a strongly worded account of their banishment for distribution to the press. The Associated Press picked up the story, and it appeared, dated December 30, 1862, in a number of newspapers, headlined, in one case, &#x201c;Expulsion of Jews from General Grant&#x2019;s Department&#x2014;The Circumstances Stated and Documents Quoted.&#x201d; As a merchant, Kaskel intuitively understood the power of public opinion. He concluded his account, effectively, with a plea for help: &#x201c;On my way to Washington, in order to get this most outrageous and inhuman order of Major General Grant countermanded, I ask you, gentlemen, to lend the powerful aid of the press to the suffering cause of outraged humanity; to blot out as quick as possible this stain on our national honor, and to show the world that the American people, as a nation, brand the author of that infamous order as unworthy of their respect and confidence.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Kaskel passed through Cairo, Illinois, and probably Cincinnati on his Paul Revere&#x2013;like ride to Washington. He spread the word of Grant&#x2019;s order wherever he went. Armed with letters from Rabbi Max Lilienthal of Cincinnati and the prominent Cincinnati merchant Daniel Wolf, he hurried on. He was determined to do whatever it took to have Grant&#x2019;s order reversed and his faith in America restored.<br>&nbsp;<br>While Kaskel made his way as quickly as he could to Washington, other Jewish leaders, alerted to the order, swung into action. The most important by far was Isaac Mayer Wise, Cincinnati&#x2019;s most prominent rabbi, the editor of the <i>Israelite, </i>the region&#x2019;s most widely read Jewish newspaper, and one of the country&#x2019;s leading proponents of Jewish religious reform. At forty-three, the hyperactive, somewhat contentious, and voluble rabbi was in the prime of his life. He had been in America for sixteen years, achieved mastery of the English language, and won friends in high places. Pragmatic, flexible, and politically savvy, he generally advocated compromise for the sake of unity both within the Jewish community and in the nation as a whole. Consequently, the &#x201c;live and let live&#x201d; policy of Democrats like Stephen A. Douglas strongly appealed to him, the policies of Abraham Lincoln and the Republican Party largely repelled him, and the &#x201c;fanatical&#x201d; abolitionists, some of whom displayed deep religious prejudice against Jews, frightened and alienated him. Residing opposite a border state, with &#x201c;dear friends and near relations .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in either section of the country,&#x201d; Wise favored peace and sectional self-determination to uphold the union, even if that meant acquiescing to slavery. When it came to the rights of Jews, though, he was uncompromising. He was a one-man Anti-Defamation League, chronicling antisemitic slurs and actions and doing all in his power to combat them.<br>&nbsp;<br>News of Grant&#x2019;s order first reached Wise independently of Kaskel.

Ambitious, charismatic, and beautiful, Nefertiti is destined to marry Amunhotep, an unstable young pharaoh. It is hoped by all that her strong personality will temper the young Amunhotep&#x2019;s heretical desire to forsake Egypt&#x2019;s ancient gods, overthrow the priests of Amun, and introduce a new sun god for all to worship. <br><br>From the moment of her arrival in Thebes, Nefertiti is beloved by the people. Her charisma is matched only by her husband&#x2019;s perceived generosity: Amunhotep showers his subjects with lofty promises. The love of the commoners will not be enough, however, if the royal couple is not able to conceive an heir, and as Nefertiti turns her attention to producing a son, she fails to see that the powerful priests, along with the military, are plotting against her husband&#x2019;s rule.

But as Nefertiti learns of the precariousness of her reign, she declares that her sister must remain at court and marry for political gain, not love. To achieve her independence, Mutnodjmet must defy her sister, the most powerful woman in Egypt&#x2014;while also remaining loyal to the needs of her family. <br><br>Love, betrayal, political unrest, plague, and religious conflict&#x2014;<i>Nefertiti</i> brings ancient Egypt to life in vivid detail.

She lives in California with her husband and cat, Anubis.Chapter One<br>1351 BCE<br><br>Peret, Season of Growing<br><br>WHEN THE SUN set over Thebes, splaying its last rays over the limestone cliffs, we walked in a long procession across the sand. In the twisting line that threaded between the hills, the viziers of Upper and Lower Egypt came first, then the priests of Amun, followed by hundreds of mourners. The sand cooled rapidly in the shadows. I could feel the grains between the toes of my sandals, and when the wind blew under my thin linen robe, I shivered. I stepped out of line so I could see the sarcophagus, carried on a sledge by a team of oxen so the people of Egypt would know how wealthy and great our crown prince had been. Nefertiti would be jealous that she&#x2019;d had to miss this.<br><br>I will tell her all about it when I get home, I thought. If she is being nice to me.<br><br>The bald-headed priests walked behind our family, for we were even more important than the representatives of the gods. The incense they swung from golden balls made me think of giant beetles, stinking up the air whichever way they went. When the funeral procession reached the mouth of the valley, the rattling of the sistrums stopped and the mourners went silent. On every cliff, families had gathered to see the prince, and now they looked down as the High Priest of Amun performed the Opening of the Mouth, to give Tuthmosis back his senses in the Afterlife. The priest was younger than the viziers of Egypt, but even so, men like my father stood back, deferring to his power when he touched a golden ankh to the mouth of the gure on the sarcophagus and announced, &#x201c;The royal falcon has flown to heaven. Amunhotep the Younger is arisen in his place.&#x201d;<br><br>A wind echoed between the cliffs, and I thought I could hear the rush of the falcon&#x2019;s wings as the crown prince was freed from his body and ascended to the sky. There was a great amount of shuffling, children looking around the legs of their parents to see the new prince. I, too, craned my neck.<br><br>&#x201c;Where is he?&#x201d; I whispered. &#x201c;Where is Amunhotep the Younger?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In the tomb,&#x201d; my father replied. His bald head shone dully in the setting sun, and in the deepening of the shadows his face appeared hawkish.<br><br>&#x201c;But doesn&#x2019;t he want the people to see him?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>&#x201c;No, senit.&#x201d; His word for little girl. &#x201c;Not until he&#x2019;s been given what his brother was promised.&#x201d;<br><br>I frowned. &#x201c;And what is that?&#x201d;<br><br>He clenched his jaw. &#x201c;The coregency,&#x201d; he replied.<br><br>When the ceremony was finished, soldiers spread out to stop commoners from following us into the valley, and our small party was expected to walk on alone. Behind us, the team of oxen heaved, pulling their golden cargo across the sand. Around us, cliffs rose against the darkening sky.<br><br>&#x201c;We will be climbing,&#x201d; my father warned, and my mother paled slightly. We were cats, she and I, frightened of places we couldn&#x2019;t understand, valleys whose sleeping Pharaohs watched from secret chambers. Nefertiti would have crossed this valley without pause, a falcon in her fearlessness, just like our father.<br><br>We walked to the eerie rattle of the sistrums, and I watched my golden sandals reflect the dying light. As we ascended the cliffs, I stopped to look down over the land.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t stop,&#x201d; my father cautioned. &#x201c;Keep going.&#x201d;<br><br>We trudged onward through the hills while the animals snorted their way up the rocks. The priests went before us now, carrying torches to light our way as we walked. Then the High Priest hesitated, and I wondered if he&#x2019;d lost his bearing in the night.<br><br>&#x201c;Untie the sarcophagus and free the oxen,&#x201d; he commanded, and I saw, carved into the face of the cliff, the entrance to the tomb. Children shifted in their beads and women&#x2019;s bangles clinked together as they passed each other looks. Then I saw the narrow staircase leading down into the earth and understood their fear.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like this,&#x201d; my mother whispered.<br><br>The priests relieved the oxen of their burden, heaving the gilded sarcophagus onto their backs. Then my father squeezed my hand to give me courage and we followed our dead prince into his chamber, out of the dying sun and into total darkness.<br><br>Carefully, so as not to slip on the rocks, we descended into the slick bowels of the earth, staying close to the priests and their reed-dipped torches. Inside the tomb, the light cast shadows across the painted scenes of Tuthmosis&#x2019;s twenty years in Egypt. There were women dancing, wealthy noblemen hunting, Queen Tiye serving her eldest son honeyed lotus and wine. I pressed my mother&#x2019;s hand for comfort, and when she said nothing, I knew she was offering up silent prayers to Amun.<br><br>Below us, the heavy air grew dank and the smell of the tomb became that of shifted earth. Images appeared and disappeared in the flickering torchlight: yellow painted women and laughing men, children floating lotus blossoms along the River Nile. But most fearsome was the blue-faced god of the underworld, holding the crook and flail of Egypt. &#x201c;Osiris,&#x201d; I whispered, but no one heard.<br><br>We kept walking, into the most secretive chambers of the earth, then we entered a vaulted room and I gasped. This was where all the prince&#x2019;s earthly treasures were gathered: painted barges, golden chariots, sandals trimmed in leopard fur. We passed through this room to the innermost burial chamber, and my father leaned close to me and whispered, &#x201c;Remember what I told you.&#x201d;<br><br>Inside the empty chamber, Pharaoh and his queen stood side by side. In the light of the torches, it was impossible to see anything but their shadowy gures and the long sarcophagus of the departed prince. I stretched out my arms in obeisance and my aunt nodded solemnly at me, remembering my face from her infrequent visits to our family in Akhmim. My father never took Nefertiti or I into Thebes. He kept us away from the palace, from the intrigues and ostentation of the court. Now, in the flickering light of the tomb, I saw that the queen hadn&#x2019;t changed in the six years since I had last seen her. She was still small and pale. Her light eyes appraised me as I held out my arms, and I wondered what she thought of my dark skin and unusual height. I straightened, and the High Priest of Amun opened the Book of the Dead, his voice intoning the words of dying mortals to the gods.<br><br>&#x201c;Let my soul come to me from wherever it is. Come for my soul, O you Guardians of the heavens. May my soul see my corpse, may it rest on my mummified body which will never be destroyed or perish . . .&#x201d;<br><br>I searched the chamber for Amunhotep the Younger. He was standing away from the sarcophagus and the canopic jars that would carry Tuthmosis&#x2019;s organs to the Afterlife. He was taller than I was, handsome despite his light curling hair, and I wondered if we could expect great things from him when it was his brother who had always been meant to reign. He shifted toward a statue of the goddess Mut, and I remembered that Tuthmosis had been a cat lover in his life. With him would go his beloved Ta-Miw, wrapped inside her own miniature sarcophagus of gold. I touched my mother&#x2019;s arm gently and she turned.<br><br>&#x201c;Did they kill her?&#x201d; I whispered, and she followed my eyes to the little coffin beside the prince.<br><br>My mother shook her head, and as the priests took up the sistrums she replied, &#x201c;They said she stopped eating once the crown prince was dead.&#x201d;<br><br>The High Priest began chanting the Song to the Soul, a lament to Osiris and the jackal god, Anubis. Then he snapped shut the Book of the Dead and announced, &#x201c;The blessing of the organs.&#x201d;<br><br>Queen Tiye stepped forward. She knelt in the dirt, kissing each of the canopic jars in turn. Then Pharaoh did the same, and I saw him turn sharply, searching for his younger son in the darkness. &#x201c;Come,&#x201d; he commanded.<br><br>His youngest son didn&#x2019;t move.<br><br>&#x201c;Come!&#x201d; he shouted, and his voice was magnified a hundred times in the chamber.<br><br>No one breathed. I looked at my father, and he shook his head sternly.<br><br>&#x201c;Why should I bow to him in obeisance?&#x201d; Amunhotep demanded. &#x201c;He would have handed Egypt over to the Amun priests like every king that came before him!&#x201d;<br><br>I covered my mouth, and for a moment I thought the Elder would move across the burial chamber to kill him. But Amunhotep was his only surviving son, the only legitimate heir to Egypt&#x2019;s throne, and like every seventeen-year-old crown prince in our history, the people would expect to see him enthroned as coruler. The Elder would be Pharaoh of Lower Egypt and Thebes, and Amunhotep coregent of Upper Egypt from Memphis. If this son also died, the Elder&#x2019;s line would be finished. The queen walked swiftly to where her youngest son stood. &#x201c;You will bless your brother&#x2019;s organs,&#x201d; she commanded.<br><br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because he is a Prince of Egypt!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And so am I!&#x201d; Amunhotep said wildly.<br><br>Queen Tiye&#x2019;s eyes narrowed. &#x201c;Your brother served this kingdom by joining Egypt&#x2019;s army. He was a High Priest of Amun, dedicated to the gods.&#x201d;<br><br>Amunhotep laughed. &#x201c;So you loved him better because he could butcher what he blessed?&#x201d;<br><br>Queen Tiyes inhaled angrily. &#x201c;Go to your father. Ask him to make a soldier of you. Then we will see what kind of Pharaoh you shall become.&#x201d;<br><br>Amunhotep turned, stooping rashly before Pharaoh in the midst of his brother&#x2019;s funeral. &#x201c;I will become a warrior like my brother,&#x201d; he swore. The hem of his white cloak trailed in the dirt, and the viziers shook their heads. &#x201c;Together, you and I can raise Aten above Amun,&#x201d; he promised. &#x201c;We can rule the way your father once envisioned.&#x201d;<br><br>Pharaoh held on to his walking stick, ...</p><h2>Farmer Giles Of Ham</h2><p>A tale of the days when giants and dragons walked the kingdom, this tells the story of Farmer Giles of Ham who is fat, unheroic and red-bearded.

"The facts of life and death remain the same. We live and die, we love and grieve, we breed and disappear. And between these existential gravities, we search for meaning, save our memories, leave a record for those who will remember us." So writes Thomas Lynch, poet and funeral director, and author of the highly praised <i>The Undertaking</i>, winner of an American Book Award and finalist for the National Book Award, as he continues to examine the relations between the "literary and mortuary arts." The essays assembled here explore the human condition at the intersection of millennia, beleaguered by choices and changes, encumbered by merger and acquisition, numbed by maths and technologies, in search of the meaning of life and time, our lives and times. Lynch tenders life and times--sextons, muckrakers, clergy, caskets, condoms, loved poems, a hated cat, the mall, Main Street. In an age that seeks to define human experience in retail, high-tech, or pop-psyche terms, these essays speak to the existentials: between being human and ceasing to be, between birth and death, we are bodies in motion and at rest.</p><p>All poets who take their jobs seriously spend a good deal of their time pondering death. Few, though, have logged as many hours as Thomas Lynch, who for 25 years has been a funeral director in Milford, Michigan. As might be expected from a writer who performs "daily stations with the local lately dead," Lynch's second essay collection, <i>Bodies in Motion and at Rest: On Metaphor and Mortality</i>, has a lot to say about both the current state of his industry (with its "Walmartized" funerals) and the attitude Americans have toward death, which is more or less to pretend it doesn't exist and to hope it never happens to us or anyone we know. Of course, this leads to our inability to properly understand life. And we become one of those stunned mumblers whom the author has spent a lifetime consoling and selling caskets to at Lynch &amp; Sons. <p> As in his previous collection, <i>The Undertaking: Life Studies from the Dismal Trade</i>, Lynch muses on contemporary American life with an appealing mix of light and dark. The effect can be striking, especially in his essays on the death of a crafty old gravedigger; the alcoholism he inherited from his father and, devastatingly, watches develop in his son; his divorce and the wicked poem he later writes about his ex-wife. His prose is always lively, though in several essays he relies on the same cultural touchstones--Bill Gates, the Internet, his Catholic-school upbringing and the "wonderful breasts" of the nuns, and (oddly) the Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young song "Love the One You're With." More unfortunately, he can lapse into familiar generalizations of the "we boomers" or "as an Irish Catholic" variety. Then again, funeral directors must keep an eye on the habits and statistics of generations and groups (as Lynch puts it, "our favorite parlor game is Demographics and Expectancies"), so perhaps a few familiar generalities are excusable--an occupational hazard of the poet-essayist-mortician. In Lynch's case (and there probably isn't another), they seem a fair exchange for his entertaining and often surprisingly humble wisdom. <i>--John Ponyicsanyi</i></p><b>Thomas Lynch</b> lives in Milford, Michigan, where he is the funeral director.</p><h2>War on the Saints</h2><p>The premise of War on the Saints is that the end-time onslaught of Satan against the Christian church is well-underway.

We are brought closer than we have ever been to the great ballplayer, a man of courage and quality who became a pivotal figure in the areas of race and civil rights.<br><br>Born in the rural South, the son of a sharecropper, Robinson was reared in southern California. We see him blossom there as a student-athlete as he struggled against poverty and racism to uphold the beliefs instilled in him by his mother--faith in family, education, America, and God. <br><br>We follow Robinson through World War II, when, in the first wave of racial integration in the armed forces, he was commissioned as an officer, then court-martialed after refusing to move to the back of a bus. After he plays in the Negro National League, we watch the opening of an all-American drama as, late in 1945, Branch Rickey of the Brooklyn Dodgers recognized Jack as the right player to break baseball's color barrier--and the game was forever changed.<br><br>Jack's never-before-published letters open up his relationship with his family, especially his wife, Rachel, whom he married just as his perilous venture of integrating baseball began. Her memories are a major resource of the narrative as we learn about the severe harassment Robinson endured from teammates and opponents alike; about death threats and exclusion; about joy and remarkable success. We watch his courageous response to abuse, first as a stoic endurer, then as a fighter who epitomized courage and defiance.<br><br>We see his growing friendship with white players like Pee Wee Reese and the black teammates who followed in his footsteps, and his embrace by Brooklyn's fans. We follow his blazing career: 1947, Rookie of the Year; 1949, Most Valuable Player; six pennants in ten seasons, and 1962, induction into the Hall of Fame. <br><br>But sports were merely one aspect of his life. We see his business ventures, his leading role in the community, his early support of Martin Luther King Jr., his commitment to the civil rights movement at a crucial stage in its evolution; his controversial associations with Eisenhower, Kennedy, Nixon, Humphrey, Goldwater, Nelson Rockefeller, and Malcolm X.<br><br>Rampersad's magnificent biography leaves us with an indelible image of a principled man who was passionate in his loyalties and opinions: a baseball player who could focus a crowd's attention as no one before or since; an activist at the crossroads of his people's struggle; a dedicated family man whose last years were plagued by illness and tragedy, and who died prematurely at fifty-two. He was a pathfinder, an American hero, and he now has the biography he deserves.</p><p>In baseball and beyond, 1997 has been the year of Jackie Robinson, the 50th anniversary of his obliteration of the game's color line, and a time to reflect on a marvelous man whose heroism and decency cut far beyond the foul lines. Arnold Rampersad, a Princeton professor who's edited the poetry of Langston Hughes and the essays of Richard Wright, and collaborated with tennis great Arthur Ashe on his powerful memoir <i>Days of Grace</i>, steps up to the plate here with the first truly comprehensive Robinson biography. It's an important accomplishment, ripe with historical and social insight without losing sight of the human being at its core. Thoroughly researched--Rachel Robinson gave the author access to her husband's personal papers--and filled with fascinating new detail, the book, like its subject, consistently takes the extra base, thrilling with its overall skill, depth, and perspective."An elegantly rendered, meticulously documented narrative . . .

One of the many merits of his book is the way it probes deeply beneath the surface of the legend, with all of its overtones of racial martyrdom and endurance, reminding us that Jackie Robinson was a man of many lives--a complex figure whose life both preceded his historic encounter with Branch Rickey and whose work extended well beyond the decade of 1947-1957, the years he played for the Dodgers. . . .

But it was too late. Franklin's unpublished data and crucial photograph of DNA had already been seen by her competitors at the Cambridge University lab. With the aid of these, plus their own knowledge, Watson and Crick discovered the structure of the molecule that genes are composed of -- DNA, the secret of life. Five years later, at the age of thirty-seven, after more brilliant research under J. D. Bernal at Birkbeck College, Rosalind died of ovarian cancer. In 1962, Wilkins, Crick and Watson were awarded the Nobel Prize for their elucidation of DNA's structure. Franklin's part was forgotten until she was caricatured in Watson's book <em>The Double Helix.</em></p><p>In this full and balanced biography, Brenda Maddox has been given unique access to Franklin's personal correspondence and has interviewed all the principal scientists involved, including Crick, Watson and Wilkins.</p><p>This is a powerful story, told by one of the finest biographers, of a remarkably single-minded, forthright and tempestuous young woman who, at the age of fifteen, decided she was going to be a scientist, but who was airbrushed out of the greatest scientific discovery of the twentieth century.</p></p><p><p>Brenda Maddox is an award-winning biographer whose work has been translated into ten languages. <em>Nora: A Biography of Nora Joyce,</em> won the Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Biography, the Silver PEN Award, and the French <em>Prix du Mailleur Livre Etranger.</em> Her life of D. H. Lawrence won the Whitbread Biography Award in 1974, and <em>Yeats's Ghosts,</em> on the married life of W. B. Yeats, was shortlisted for the Samuel Johnson Prize in 1998. She has been Home Affairs Editor for the <em>Economist,</em> has served as chairman of the Association of British Science Writers and is a member of the Royal Society's Science and Society Committee. She lives in London and Mid-Wales.</p>The aphorism "history is always written by the victors" is as true for science as for geopolitics. Certainly it was the case for the discovery in 1953 of the double helical structure of DNA, the most important discovery in 20th-century biology. The victors were James Watson and Francis Crick, who together with Maurice Wilkins shared the 1962 Nobel Prize for crossing the finish line first. The loser was Rosalind Franklin, who produced the x-ray data that most strongly supported the structure but was not properly acknowledged for her contributions. According to Watson's best-selling 1968 account of the great race, The Double Helix, Franklin was not even a contender, much less a major contributor. He painted her as a mere assistant to Wilkins who "had to go or be put in her place" because she had the audacity to think she might be able to work on DNA on her own. Worse yet, she "did not emphasize her feminine qualities," lamented Watson, who refers to her only as "Rosy." "The thought could not be avoided," he concluded, "that the best home for a feminist was in another person's lab." Franklin never had a chance to respond; she died of ovarian cancer in 1958. Her good friend Anne Sayre did offer a rebuttal in Rosalind Franklin and DNA, but that biography is too polemical and pedantic to be either persuasive or a good read. Now, just in time for the 50th anniversary of the double helix, noted British biographer Brenda Maddox has produced a more balanced, nuanced and informed version of the tale. Rosalind Franklin: The Dark Lady of DNA is neither a paean to Franklin nor a condemnation of her competitors. It's simply the story of a scientist's life as gleaned from extensive correspondence, published and unpublished manuscripts, laboratory notebooks, and interviews with many of the protagonists. It was an interesting life. Franklin, the daughter of a prominent Jewish family, was an "alarmingly clever" girl who spent her free time doing arithmetic for pleasure. She was educated at a series of academically rigorous schools culminating in the University of Cambridge, where, despite the fact that women were still excluded from receiving an undergraduate degree, she managed a Ph.D. in physical chemistry and developed the experimental style that was to characterize all her subsequent work-- an approach that was meticulous, albeit sometimes overly cautious. Then it was off to Paris, where she applied the new techniques of x-ray diffraction to the structure of coal. In France, Franklin bloomed both as a scientist, authoring numerous independent publications, and as a young woman free from the constraints of family and stuffy British society. It was a happy and productive period, as were her final years at Birkbeck College in London, where she collaborated with Aaron Klug on the structure of the tobacco mosaic virus. Alas, the central and most important two years of her career were spent in the far less hospitable environment of the biophysics unit at King's College London. There she immediately locked horns with Wilkins over who would get to study the structure of DNA-- a subject that had been largely ignored during World War II, with its emphasis on more practical matters, but was increasingly regarded as the problem in structural biology. Wilkins, who had been researching the matter for years, had seniority but little insight or good data. It was Franklin, a newcomer to biology, who made the critical observation that DNA exists in two distinct forms, A and B, and produced the sharpest pictures of both. They reached a compromise that Franklin would work on the A form and Wilkins on the B and went their separate ways. Or so Franklin thought. In fact, Wilkins, in a weekend visit to Cambridge, spilled the King's beans to Watson and Crick, who soon thereafter began the model building. Although their approach was less meticulous than Franklin's, it was also far quicker. A few months later it was Watson's turn to visit London, where Wilkins showed him Franklin's startlingly clear x-ray photograph of the B form. On the train back to Cambridge, Watson drew the pattern from memory on the margin of his newspaper. Yet just two months later, in their historic letter to Nature, he and Crick claimed, "We were not aware of the details of the results presented [in accompanying papers from Franklin's and Wilkins's groups] ... when we devised our structure." How did Watson and Crick, with the complicity of Wilkins, get away with so brazenly heisting "Rosy's" data? Maddox offers several theories. The most obvious is Franklin's position as a female researcher at an institution where women were still not allowed to set foot in the senior common room. There was also the matter of anti-Semitism. Franklin's family may have anglicized their name, but her uncle was the first High Commissioner of Palestine, and she was active in Jewish relief groups. She felt isolated, even ostracized, in a school where theology was the largest department and "there were swirling cassocks and dog collars everywhere." We'll probably never know the full story, but Maddox's book shines new light on one of the key characters in the tale of the double helix. Rosalind Franklin may not have had the intuition of some of her competitors, but what she did possess was equally important: integrity. <p><i>Dean H.

My parents were both professors at the University of North Carolina: my mom is a classicist (which means she knows everything you could ever imagine about myths, Latin, and words) and my dad teaches Shakespeare (which means I&#x2019;d seen&nbsp; <i>As You Like It</i>&nbsp;about five times by the age of 18.) I have one brother, who is a musician and lives in California with his son and his wife, an artist who designed my personal website. (Thanks, Mariangeles!) <br> <br> "I&#x2019;ve been writing, in one way or another, for as long as I can remember. I was always a big reader, mostly because my parents were. I used to get frustrated with my mom because she bought me books for Christmas when what I really wanted were the gifts my friends got, things like sweaters and jewelry. But I did love to read. When I was eight or nine my parents gave me an old manual typewriter and a little desk in the corner of our den, and I&#x2019;d sit there and type up my stories. I was the kind of kid that people always sighed over and said, "She has such a wild imagination," which usually meant "I wish Sarah would try to stick to the truth." I have a tendency to embellish: I think it&#x2019;s just a weakness of fiction writers. Once you learn how to make a story better, it&#x2019;s hard not to do it all the time. <br> <br> "In high school, I was lucky enough to have a big group of girlfriends that have really inspired a lot of the stories in my books. I&#x2019;m still close with my friends from that time, so it&#x2019;s never very hard to put myself back into that place, that voice. Also it doesn&#x2019;t hurt to still be living in my hometown, where it&#x2019;s a given that I&#x2019;ll bump into people I had homeroom with, or guys I had big crushes on, while I&#x2019;m pumping gas or buying stamps. It makes it hard to leave high school behind entirely, which is a good or bad thing depending on what day you ask me. I attended college at UNC, where I studied creative writing and graduated with a degree in English. (Which means I can quote small parts of many Great Works. Comes in handy occasionally, like at cocktail parties.) I&#x2019;d been on the five-and-a-half year college plan, and when I graduated my parents were hoping I&#x2019;d settle down and get a Real Job so they could stop worrying about me. But instead of doing the whole resume/pantyhose thing, I decided to stick to my job waiting tables at the world famous Flying Burrito Restaurant and try to publish a novel. At the time, I had only one very bad book I&#x2019;d written my senior year of college and the beginnings of another one. Luckily, my family was supportive and I spent a few years living in a ramshackle little house where I wrote during the day and did the restaurant thing at night. <br> <br> "Three years after graduating, I sold my first book,&nbsp; <b>That Summer</b>, but it wasn&#x2019;t until a year after that that I got offered a teaching job and left waitressing for good. I still miss it sometimes, though. It was a great job for a writer. Endless conversations to eavesdrop, tons of material, and fast money without ever taking work home. Plus, free Mexican food, the best perk of all. Now, I&#x2019;ve published four books, all for young adults. I never really intended to be YA writer, but the second book I showed my agent she thought had a strong teenage voice, so she sent it off to an editor at Orchard Books, who bought it. Even though it was in a way accidental, I&#x2019;ve found that writing for teens suits me. I do short stories, and other novels, that are for an older audience, but again and again I am brought back to the stories of high school. Maybe it&#x2019;s because so much happened to me then that I&#x2019;m not finished yet telling everything. My senior quote was from Pink Floyd (okay, I was a bit of a burnout---I spent a lot of time in the parking lot, whatever, let&#x2019;s move on) and it pretty much summed up my future, although I didn&#x2019;t know it at the time. It was: "The time is gone, the song is over, thought I&#x2019;d something more to say." It turns out that I did. <br> <br> "The books I read when I was teenager, the good ones anyway, have stuck more in my mind than anything since. I still love books, but while I couldn&#x2019;t tell you complete plots of novels I read even six months ago, I do remember even the smallest descriptive details from Lois Lowry&#x2019;s&nbsp; <b>A Summer to Die</b>&nbsp;or Judy Blume&#x2019;s&nbsp; <b>Are You There God? It&#x2019;s Me, Margaret</b>. I think it was because back then books were still somewhat new to me, and when I found an author who seemed to say just what I was feeling, it really struck me and resonated. I hope that my books do that for the people who read them: I think it&#x2019;s the best thing to which any writer can aspire. Now, I teach writing at UNC-Chapel Hill, where I&#x2019;m lucky enough to see my students find their own voice, the way I did in the same program there not so long ago. Teaching is great for me, because I get to show people how writing can really change the way you see not only yourself but the world. I&#x2019;ve found in my own life that if my writing isn&#x2019;t going well, not much else will. It is the one constant, the key to everything else. <br> <br> "As far as my other life, my non-writing life, I live in the country with my husband, some lizards, and two dogs who are completely spoiled and rule me completely. I like to work in my garden---although I have not yet perfected the art of keeping everything alive----and, in my weaker moments, shop. I have a bit of an addiction to the Gap clearance rack, to be honest. I have this strange need to buy huge quantities of black pants. How many pairs of black pants does one person need? (Obviously for me, the answer is 11 and counting. But I digress.) What else can I tell you? I love Starbucks mochas but they make me way hyper. I subscribe to too many magazines. I make a mean bean salad. I could go on, but the truth is, my books are much more exciting than I am, and that&#x2019;s a good thing. It&#x2019;s always more fun to make stuff up anyway." <br><b>Sarah Dessen</b>&nbsp;is the author of thirteen novels, which include the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestsellers&nbsp;<i>The Moon and More</i>,&nbsp;<i>What Happened to Goodbye</i>,&nbsp;<i>Along for the Ride</i>,&nbsp;<i>Lock and Key</i>,&nbsp;<i>Just Listen</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Truth About Forever</i>, and&nbsp;<i>This Lullaby</i>.

You will learn how to manifest your desires so that you&#x2019;re living the joyous and fulfilling life you deserve, you will understand how your relationships, health issues, finances, career concerns, and more are influenced by the Universal laws that govern your time/space reality, and you&#x2019;ll discover powerful processes that will help you go with the positive flow of life.</p><p>Excited about the clarity and practicality of the translated word from the Beings who call themselves Abraham, Esther and Jerry Hicks began disclosing their amazing Abraham experience to a handful of close business associates in 1986. Recognizing the practical results being received by themselves and by those people who were asking practical questions and then applying Abraham&#x2019;s answers to their own situations, Esther and Jerry made a deliberate decision to allow the teachings of Abraham to become available to an ever-widening circle of seekers of how to live a happier life. Using their San Antonio, Texas, conference center as their base, Jerry and Esther have traveled to approximately 50 cities a year since 1989, presenting interactive Law of Attraction workshops to those leaders who gather to participate in this expanding stream of progressive thought. And although worldwide attention has been given to this philosophy of Well-Being by Leading Edge thinkers and teachers who have, in turn, incorporated many of Abraham&#x2019;s Law of Attraction concepts into their best-selling books, scripts, lectures, and so forth, the primary spread of this material has been from person to person&#x2014;as individuals begin to discover the value of this form of spiritual practicality in their personal life experiences. In November 2011, Jerry made his transition into Non-Physical, and now Esther continues to conduct the Abraham workshops with the help of her physical friends and co-workers and, of course, with the Non-Physical help of Abraham and Jerry. People are able to access Abraham directly by attending the seminars in person or by participating in the online live streaming of most events. There is also an extensive YouTube library of Abraham videos. Abraham&#x2014;a group of uplifting Non-Physical teachers&#x2014;present their Broader Perspective through Esther Hicks. And as they speak to our level of comprehension through a series of loving, allowing, brilliant, yet comprehensively simple essays in print and in sound, they guide us to a clear connection with our loving Inner Being, and to uplifting self-empowerment from our Total Self.

The efforts of Henry Hardy to edit Berlin's work and reintroduce it to a broad, eager readership have gone far to remedy this. Now, Princeton is pleased to return to print, under one cover, Berlin's essays on Vico, Hamann, and Herder. These essays on three relatively uncelebrated thinkers are not marginal ruminations, but rather among Berlin's most important studies in the history of ideas. They are integral to his central project: the critical recovery of the ideas of the Counter-Enlightenment and the explanation of its appeal and consequences--both positive and (often) tragic.</p><br><p> Giambattista Vico was the anachronistic and impoverished Neapolitan philosopher sometimes credited with founding the human sciences. He opposed Enlightenment methods as cold and fallacious. J. G. Hamann was a pious, cranky dilettante in a peripheral German city. But he was brilliant enough to gain the audience of Kant, Goethe, and Moses Mendelssohn. In Hamann's chaotic and long-ignored writings, Berlin finds the first strong attack on Enlightenment rationalism and a wholly original source of the coming swell of romanticism. Johann Gottfried Herder, the progenitor of populism and European nationalism, rejected universalism and rationalism but championed cultural pluralism.</p><br><p> Individually, these fascinating intellectual biographies reveal Berlin's own great intelligence, learning, and generosity, as well as the passionate genius of his subjects. Together, they constitute an arresting interpretation of romanticism's precursors. In Hamann's railings and the more considered writings of Vico and Herder, Berlin finds critics of the Enlightenment worthy of our careful attention. But he identifies much that is misguided in their rejection of universal values, rationalism, and science. With his customary emphasis on the frightening power of ideas, Berlin traces much of the next centuries' irrationalism and suffering to the historicism and particularism they advocated. What Berlin has to say about these long-dead thinkers--in appreciation and dissent--is remarkably timely in a day when Enlightenment beliefs are being challenged not just by academics but by politicians and by powerful nationalist and fundamentalist movements.</p><br><p> The study of J. G. Hamann was originally published under the title <i>The Magus of the North: J. G. Hamann and the Origins of Modern Irrationalism</i>. The essays on Vico and Herder were originally published as <i>Vico and Herder: Two Studies in the History of Ideas</i>. Both are out of print.</p></p><p><p>"Isaiah Berlin's main preoccupation throughout his productive life was understand the nature of the modern reaction against the Enlightenment. These essays on Vico, Herder, and Hamann belong with his other profound and influential studies of the leading figures of what he called the Counter-Enlightenment. But they are also crucial for anyone hoping to understand Berlin's own analysis of modern life and politics, which has received increasing attention in recent years. Anyone interested in Berlin or those he studied will find this an essential volume."<b>--Mark Lilla, University of Chicago</b></p><p>"Isaiah Berlin is among the finest intellectual historians of recent decades. Yet his position is somewhat peculiar: for while he is clearly a scholar of enormous erudition, the characteristic style of his work is closer to that of brilliant conversation than of conventional historical scholarship. His works on Vico, Herder, and Hamann deal with thinkers who were at odds with main currents of the Enlightenment. For anyone with a historical sense, the recrudescence of so many of the characteristic notions of the 'Counter-Enlightenment' under the rubric of 'postmodernism' is striking. The recovery of these ideas is all the more effective for being a critical one: Berlin reminds his readers of some of the unfortunate historical consequences of the ideas in question."<b>--Jerry Z. Muller, Catholic University of America</b></p><b>Isaiah Berlin</b> was, until his death in 1997, a Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford. He was renowned as an essayist and as the author of many books, among them <i>Karl Marx, Four Essays on Liberty, Russian Thinkers, The Sense of Reality, The Proper Study of Mankind,</i> and from Princeton, <i>Concepts and Categories, Personal Impressions, The Crooked Timber of Humanity, The Roots of Romanticism, The Power of Ideas,</i> and <i>Three Critics of the Enlightenment</i>. <b>Henry Hardy</b>, a Fellow of Wolfson College, Oxford, is one of Isaiah Berlin's literary trustees.

In bringing this remarkable and complex philosophy to life, he describes the meditational practices by which emptiness can be realized and shows throughout that, far from being merely abstract, these teachings can be vivid and utterly practical. Presented in six parts, this book is indispensable for those wishing to delve deeply into Buddhist thought.</p><p>Jeffrey Hopkins is Professor Emeritus of Tibetan Buddhist Studies at the University of Virginia, where he taught Tibetan Studies and Tibetan language for more than thirty years. He received a BA <i>magna cum laude</i> from Harvard University in 1963, trained for five years at the Lamaist Buddhist Monastery of America (now the Tibetan Buddhist Learning Center) in New Jersey, and received a PhD in Buddhist Studies from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1973. From 1979 to 1989 he served as His Holiness the Dalai Lama's chief interpreter into English on lecture tours in the U.S., Canada, Southeast Asia, Great Britain, and Switzerland. He has published more than twenty-five books, including <i>Meditation on Emptiness</i>, a seminal work of English language scholarship on Tibetan Madhyamaka thought, as well as translations of works by Tsongkhapa, Dolpopa, and His Holiness the Fourteenth Dalai Lama. At the University of Virginia he founded programs in Buddhist Studies and Tibetan Studies and served as Director of the Center for South Asian Studies for twelve years.Text: English, Tibetan</p><h2>Bar Barakah: A Parent&#39;s Guide to a Christian Bar Mitzvah</h2><p>Bar Barakah means in the Hebrew language &#34;Son of the Blessing.&#34; Parents the World over are rediscovering the need to bless their children at the time of puberty and release them into adulthood.

The elder C�zanne had been away from home for so long that the boy has difficulty recognizing his father when he joins him on a painting expedition in the mountains of southern France. They quickly become fast friends, and the artist takes great pleasure in painting a portrait of his apple-cheeked son. Most of his paintings, however, are landscapes of the mountain country where they are camping, although the people who live nearby often laugh at the artist&#39;s pictures, which they think are poor. But young Paul admires his father&#39;s work--and he is not alone. A picture dealer from Paris happens to be in the region, and when he sees C�zanne&#39;s paintings, he thinks they are wonderful. Before long, C�zanne becomes famous and wealthy. The story, enhanced with Laurence Anholt&#39;s illustrations on every page, include several that are reproductions of C�zanne&#39;s famous paintings.</p><p>(back cover) <br> One day, young Paul receives a letter from his father, the painter Paul C zanne, inviting him on a painting expedition high in the mountains of Provence.

It is a paean to individual courage and initiative and focuses on one of the few bright spots in the conduct of established governments toward the native people of North America.</p></p><p>It is extremely rare that a book addresses the positive side of the struggle between Native Americans and the United States Government. This book tells a fascinating story that involves not only Indians devoted to a decades-long struggle to reclaim their sacred Blue Lake and preserve their culture but also includes a host of prominent non-native figures who allied themselves with the Indians&#39; quest. The list includes Fred Harris, Ted and Robert Kennedy, Stuart Udall, Barry Goldwater, George McGovern, Spiro Agnew, Richard Nixon, John Collier, Oliver La Farge, and Eliot Porter. The Taos Indians&#39; persistent attempts to reclaim their sacred lands repeatedly met with failure until 1970 when President Richard Nixon took a personal interest in the matter. Nixon oversaw the formation of a bipartisan campaign that eventually brought the Blue Lake issue to a successful roll call vote in the Senate. This book shows how the battle for Blue Lake became the focus of national debate and the centerpiece for the Indian &#34;new deal&#34; commenced under Nixon&#39;s leadership.

Their other thirty-three novels include the best-selling series the <b>Zion Chronicles</b> and the <b>Zion Covenant</b>. Together they have won eight Evangelical Christian Publishers Gold Medallion awards. The Thoenes live in Nevada and London, England.This third installment in the Zion's Legacy series continues the Thoenes' tradition of strong characters and fine historical research without succumbing to the embarrassing anti-Muslim stereotypes that so marred their first two novels. The scene is still Palestine of May 1948; war-weary Jewish refugees struggle to retain hold of Jerusalem's Old City, while Muslim forces squeeze the city from all sides, cutting off supplies. Just outside the city, other Jews attempt an Alamo-like last stand at the battle of Latrun, which ends disastrously, leaving them no road to resupply Jerusalem. Much of the ensuing suspense revolves around Jewish attempts to find, and then utilize, an ancient Roman path that will circumvent the Muslim armies and relieve the beleaguered forces in the Old City. The Thoenes' Christian message can sometimes be overstated: a mysterious Jesus figure appears disguised as an elderly gardener, and armies that oppose the Jews find themselves turned back by divinely whipped desert winds and angry hornets (per biblical promises to God's Chosen People). The authors capitalize on the poignant stories of the Jews who are fighting for their homeland. A Hasidic father whose son is the only one of his six children to survive the Holocaust loses his mind when the boy is killed by a grenade, and a Russian family that miraculously survived the Holocaust intact is not so fortunate in the Promised Land. For Christian fiction writers, the Thoenes allow a liberal amount of gory violence (this is war, after all) and present female characters with surprising chutzpah. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Life and Loves of a She-Devil</h2><p>Ruth Patchett never thought of herself as particularly devilish. Rather the opposite in fact -- simply a tall, not terribly attractive woman living a quiet life as a wife and mother in a respectable suburb. But when she discovers that her husband is having a passionate affair with the lovely romantic novelist Mary Fisher, she is so seized by envy that she becomes truly diabolic. Within weeks she has burnt down the family home, collected the insurance, made love to the local drunk and embarked on a course of destruction and revenge. A blackly comic satire of the war of the sexes, LIFE AND LOVES OF A SHE DEVIL is the fantasy of the wronged woman made real.</p><p>This is not a book for everyone, but its admirers are vigorously enthusiastic. For example: <br>Rhoda Koenig in New York Magazine, who calls it ." . . a novel of blazingly hot revenge, one that amply illustrates the saying about heaven having no rage like love turned to hate, nor hell a fury like a woman scorned." <br>Or Rosalyn Drexler, who said on the front page of The New York Times Book Review, "It affords a scintillating, mindboggling, vicarious thrill for any reader who has ever fantasized dishing out retribution for one wrong or another."<br>Or Carol E. Rinzler, who wrote on The Washington Post Book World's front page, ." . . what makes this a powerfully funny and oddly powerful book is the energy of the language and of the intellect that conceived it, an energy that vibrates off the pages and that makes SHE-DEVIL as exceptional a book in the remembering as in the reading . . . . a small, mad masterpiece."&#39;Fantastic...a carefully worked-out fable, satiric and finally bitter...Just about everyone in this novel is selfish and horrid, but Weldon tells her story with infectious, wicked glee. Just &#39;how&#39; Ruth manages her revenge on Bobbo, Mary Fisher and the brats is what makes this malicious parable so palatable.

In <i>The 7th Infantry Regiment: Combat in an Age of Terror</i>, heralded military historian John C. McManus told the dramatic story of the 7th Infantry Regiment's modern combat experiences, from Korea through Iraq. Now, in this compelling prequel, McManus relates the rest of the 7th's amazing, and previously untold, story from the Battle of New Orleans through the end of World War II. No American unit has earned more battle streamers and few can boast more Medal of Honor winners.<br><br>In the months leading up to the War of 1812, Congress authorized the creation of this regiment. It fought with distinction at the Battle of New Orleans, anchoring General Andrew Jackson's main defensive line, forever earning the nickname "Cottonbalers" because the soldiers of the 7th were said to have battled the British from behind large rows of cotton bales. From now on, whenever Americans went to war, the Cottonbalers would always find themselves in the center of the action, where the danger was greatest.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Between these covers is the whole story, told through the eyes of the soldiers--the realities of combat expressed in raw human terms. From the marshy grounds of the Chalmette plantation in New Orleans to the daunting heights of Chapultepec in Mexico City; from the bloody horror of the long, stone wall at Fredericksburg to the deadly crossfire of the Wheatfield at Gettysburg, from the shocking gore of Custer's massacre at Little Bighorn to the desperation of dusty frontier battles; from the foggy hills of Santiago in Cuba to the muddy, pockmarked no man's land of Belleau Wood in France; from the invasion of North Africa to Sicily, Anzio, southern France, the Vosges Mountains, the breaching of the Rhine, and the 7th's triumphant capture of Hitler's mountain home at Berchtesgaden in May, 1945, this remarkable book chronicles multiple generations of Cottonbalers who have fought and bled for their country. <br><br>&nbsp;<br><br><i>American Courage, American Carnage</i> is an inside look at the drama, tragedy, fatigue and pathos of war, from America's early nineteenth century struggles as a fledgling republic to its emergence as a superpower in the twentieth. Based on nearly a decade of archival research, battlefield visits, interviews, and intensive study, and illustrated with copious maps and photographs, this book is a moving, authoritative, tale of Americans in combat. <br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;<br></p><p><br>John C. McManus is associate professor of U.S. Military History at Missouri University of Science and Technology. The author of seven previous books, including <i>The 7th Infantry Regiment: Combat in an Age of Terror, the Korean War through the Present</i>, he is a leading expert on the history of Americans in combat. A member of the editorial advisory board at <i>World War II</i> magazine and <i>World War II Quarterly</i>, McManus was recently named to History News Network's list of Top Young Historians. He currently serves as official historian for the 7th Infantry Regiment Association. He lives in St. Louis with his wife Nancy.<br>Chapter One <p></p>The Beginning of the Regiment <p></p><p></p>The Battle of New Orleans <p></p><p></p>Officially,m and directly, the 7th Infantry came into existence on January 11, 1812, when the United States, after years of tension over neutrality rights, began preparing for imminent hostilities with Great Britain. At that time Congress authorized the raising of several infantry regiments for the coming war. Fair enough, but unfortunately, the story of the 7th&#x2019;s lineage is far more complicated than those simple facts might indicate. To begin with, a unit called the 7th Infantry Regiment existed as early as 1798, when the country endured a war scare with France and Congress passed a law briefly raising the strength of the tiny Regular Army. That version of the 7th Regiment existed for two years and was then disbanded. Then, in 1808, Congress revived it, partially due to the recruiting efforts of a young officer named Zachary Taylor, who would later become president of the United States. Portions of this 7th Infantry fought at such battles as Tippecanoe in 1811 and Fort Harrison in 1812. Later the whole regiment fought at the Battle of New Orleans in 1815. <p></p><p></p>So why the confusion? In May 1815, after the war with Britain, Congress, in a decision that would befuddle and vex future generations of military unit genealogists, ordered that the 7th consolidate with the 3rd and 44th Infantry Regiments to form the 1st Infantry Regiment, which still exists today. Three other regiments, the 8th, 24th, and 39th, were organized into a new version of the 7th Infantry Regiment. The oldest of these vanishing regiments, the 8th, had been founded on January 11, 1812, which accounts for the "birth" date mentioned earlier. This reorganization might have made sense to a Congress concerned primarily with downsizing the Army, but it played hell with unit integrity and traditions for many years to come. <p></p><p></p>For decades the Army cared little for such nostalgia, until General George B. McClellan in 1862 began the practice of allowing units to fly battle and campaign streamers with their colors. McClellan was a poor fighting general, but he intuitively understood how to build soldier morale. He correctly believed that emphasizing a unit&#x2019;s proud lineage would contribute to pride, discipline, and combat effectiveness. The 1862 version of the 7th Infantry Regiment naturally included New Orleans amid its battle streamers. By this time the unit had built a proud heritage, handed down through generations of antebellum soldiers, and that heritage began at New Orleans because soldiers from the old 7th Infantry Regiment had fought tenaciously there. The regiment even acquired a nickname as a result of its key role in this battle&#x2014;the Cottonbalers. Supposedly, the soldiers of the old 7th fought the British from behind bales of cotton that had been hauled to their positions from New Orleans warehouses. Although this is probably not true&#x2014; British cannonballs would have easily set such cotton bales afire&#x2014;the name stuck and fostered a spirit of identity and pride among the soldiers who served in the "new" 7th Regiment born during the reorganization of 1815. <p></p><p></p>For most of the nineteenth century the Army allowed the 7th Infantry to include New Orleans among its battle streamers, even though technically this post-1815 version of the 7th had not fought there, since it was the product of what had been three other regiments not involved in the battle. In 1895 the War Department decided to address the innumerable lineage problems created by the 1815 reorganization. As a result, the War Department stripped the 7th of its New Orleans streamer. Then, in 1896, the War Department reversed itself. But, fourteen years later, it reversed itself again, ruling that New Orleans could not be counted among the 7th&#x2019;s battles. For several years this view prevailed, and with war in Europe on the horizon, no one much cared. After the war, though, 7th Regiment officers voiced furious opposition to this policy. For one thing, the city of New Orleans had in 1919 adopted the 7th as "Louisiana&#x2019;s Own." For another, the unit&#x2019;s nickname and much of its heritage stemmed from its central role in the Battle of New Orleans. One officer summed up the general attitude nicely: "It is not believed that the War Department in doing this realized how deep was the feeling in the 7th Infantry because of this action. In some of our old Infantry regiments . . . the esprit de corps and regimental traditions built around old battles have been more or less broken up." The War Department relented in 1923 and issued a compromise. The 7th would receive credit for New Orleans (and other smaller engagements in which the "old" 7th participated) but would trace its birth to 1812 instead of 1798. This was a wise decision. After all, what difference did it really make that the actual officers and men who served at New Orleans finished their postwar careers as members of the 1st Infantry Regiment? Most of them left the Army within months of the battle anyway. Direct lineage notwithstanding, logic would dictate that those who fought under the colors of a unit called the 7th Regiment in early 1815 would share a common heritage with soldiers of a unit with the same name and colors, no matter the year. As a result, the modern 7th Infantry can rightfully and officially trace its heritage to the Battle of New Orleans, and this is where the combat history of the unit can begin.1 <p></p><p></p>At New Orleans the Cottonbalers fought their first battle as a cohesive regiment, but previously, groups of them had been involved in fighting the battles of Tippecanoe and Fort Harrison. The latter is particularly interesting because in the first year of the War of 1812 Taylor commanded a motley assortment of sick and hungry 7th infantrymen at this fort near present-day Terre Haute, Indiana. A group of several hundred Native Americans, under the leadership of the famous chief Tecumseh, attacked the tiny fort on September 4. At the outset of the war, Tecumseh had allied himself with Britain, mainly because of his antipathy to American settlers who were steadily but surely encroaching westward into present-day Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan. When Tecum-seh&#x2019;s troops arrived at Fort Harrison, they shot at the fort and set fire to one of its blockhouses. The flames spread with alarming speed and provoked anguished screams from several women and children who had taken refuge within the dubious security of the fort. Unnerved by the fear of the civilians, the soldiers wavered in carrying out Taylor&#x2019;s orders to man their posts and shoot back at the Indians. Like any good commander, Taylor sprang to action and set an immediate example for his troops: "I saw that by throwing off part of the roof that joined the blockhouse that was on fire, and keeping the end perfectly wet, the whole row of buildings might be saved, and leave only an entrance of 18 to 20 feet for the Indians to enter after the blockhouse was consumed. A temporary breastwork might be erected to prevent their entering there. I convinced the men that this could be done, and it appeared to inspire them with new life, and never did the men act with more firmness and desperation."2 Eventually the men put out the fires, plugged the gap in blockhouses, and hunkered down in safety while Tecumseh&#x2019;s men ineffectually shot arrows and musket balls at the fort. The chief withdrew his soldiers out of range of the fort&#x2019;s guns, and before he could mount a new attack, a U.S. Army relief force arrived at Fort Harrison. Tecumseh&#x2019;s forces slipped away to fight again elsewhere, and Taylor became a war hero.3 <p></p><p></p>THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF THE WAR OF 1812 FEATURED American offensives, generally aimed at Canada. Knowing that the British were preoccupied with battling Napoleon Bonaparte&#x2019;s French Army in Europe, American leaders were determined to hit the British swiftly and effectively before their superior military power and resources could come into play in the Western Hemisphere. It didn&#x2019;t work. The amateurish American offensives failed miserably. By 1814 the British had defeated Napoleon and could now send a vast armada and army westward to deal with the contentious, outgunned Americans. The British planned a three-pronged offensive: one out of Canada aimed at Lake Champlain and the Hudson valley, one in the Chesapeake states aimed at Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, and the third aimed at the southern coast of America, primarily the port cities of Mobile and New Orleans. They went one for three. The northern prong failed in the face of American naval strength on the waters of upstate New York. The Chesapeake prong succeeded. Here the British defeated a force of pitifully led and trained American militia forces at the Battle of Bladensburg. They waltzed into Washington and burned the President&#x2019;s Mansion, the Capitol, and other government buildings, but rain put out the fires before destruction was complete. Their southern prong failed, though, partially because of the 7th Infantry Regiment. <p></p><p></p>Throughout much of 1814, General Andrew Jackson, in command of American forces in the 7th Military District, which covered the southern coast, warily watched for British movements in his area. The year before, he had led a successful campaign against the Creek nation in present-day Florida and Alabama, depriving the British of a natural ally in their coming offensive. Nonetheless, a British officer reported to his superiors that the Creeks were ready and willing to fight Jackson&#x2019;s forces again. The British sent soldiers and supplies to Pensacola and set up a base, under the approving eyes of Spanish authorities who weakly controlled northern Florida. Fully informed of these British moves, Jackson attacked Pensacola and ejected the British. But most of their strength was still at sea, bearing down on Mobile and perhaps New Orleans. The latter city had come under American control roughly ten years before as a result of the Louisiana Purchase. In early December 1814, Jackson hurried his small force back to New Orleans. Previously he had believed Mobile would be the main target, but intelligence sources now told him that a British amphibious force of about six thousand troops was planning to invade Louisiana and capture New Orleans.4 <p></p><p></p>He immediately set to work strengthening his defenses near the city and along the rivers, swamps, and deltas south of New Orleans. The 7th Infantry constituted a vital component of those defenses. Eight companies of the unit arrived in New Orleans in early 1814 and endured garrison duty for most of the year. Two companies were dispatched to Fort St. Philip, a strongpoint on the lower mouth of the Mississippi River. For the other six companies in New Orleans, disease was rife, life was stark, and discipline was harsh. Many soldiers could not resist the temptations of liquor, women, and trouble in New Orleans. This led to a sharp rise in court-martials. One sergeant was charged with "being drunk when sergeant of the police on the evening of the 17th [of January]. He plead not guilty. The court finds the prisoner guilty and sentences him to be reduced to ranks." Another noncommissioned officer, a Corporal Hall, did something even worse. One night in early April 1814, he brought a prostitute, "an indian squaw known by the name of &#x2018;toky,&#x2019; " with him into the guardhouse of which he was in command. He was charged with shameful conduct. "Remaining or lying apart from the members of the guard with the said prostitute and not suffering any candle, or other light in the guardhouse during the time in the evening." The court-martial found Hall guilty. His night of carnal fun cost him his stripes. <p></p><p></p>Regular privates who were found guilty in such proceedings fared much worse. For instance, one private received twelve slaps with a paddle for "neglect of duty." Apparently he left a water-collecting detail and wandered off into the city. Another man got six slaps for drunkenness on duty. Every now and then an enlisted man was accused of petty thievery or a violent crime. For example, on November 11, 1814, Corporal Wood Long and Privates Henry Helm and John Archer were charged with improper conduct for assaulting a citizen in town. "While some of them held him [the citizen] others attempted to force from him his watch, and in the act broke it, on or about 8th November 1814. To which charge they generally plead not guilty. The court finds the prisoner John Archer guilty as charged and sentences him to receive ten slaps with a paddle, and acquits Corporal Wood Long and Henry Helm."5 Actually, Archer was lucky he didn&#x2019;t get worse because the twenty-year-old laborer from Sevier County, Tennessee, had constantly gotten himself in trouble for a range of offenses, including drunkenness and absence without leave, ever since joining the regiment this summer before.6 <p></p><p></p>Most of the men of the regiment did not come from cities, and they had a hard time meshing with the population of New Orleans, who found the soldiers&#x2019; rough-hewn habits to be outside the boundaries of "acceptable society." Particularly distasteful was the soldiers&#x2019; tendency to urinate in public&#x2014;everywhere and anywhere. The typical 7th infantryman saw no reason not to relieve himself wherever and whenever the need arose, no matter who happened to be around. When it came to bathing, the soldiers often stripped naked and washed themselves in the Mississippi River. The local New Orleans belles who witnessed this brand of hygiene maintenance complained loudly to the regiment&#x2019;s officers, who dutifully issued an order to stop bathing naked in the river. One suspects that the practices of public bathing and urination did not end completely, though.7 <p></p><p></p>The men who populated the regiment on the eve of the Battle of New Orleans were mostly frontiersmen and southerners with little patience for social niceties or high society. One company was composed almost entirely of shoemakers and farmers from Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee.,sup&gt;8 The other companies were made up mostly of farmers, laborers, artisans, and seamen who came from backgrounds on the margins of respectability in American life. While not quite poor and destitute, neither were they educated or financially well off. Some had been recruited by Taylor a few years before the war. Others were recruited from around the New Orleans area in the months leading up to the battle. Some signed up during the war for patriotic reasons or because their lives had been disrupted by the war. A few were immigrants from Ireland, England, or Sweden. Most likely, the combatants of the 7th were all white, since the U.S. Army did not permit blacks in regular units. The lone exception to this color line was Jordan Noble, a musician from Georgia who sounded the call to arms for the regiment on January 8, 1815, and was apparently held in fairly high esteem, given the racial mores of the time.9 Collectively, the men of the 7th got into plenty of mischief. If they wanted something (usually liquor), they went after it, regardless of the consequences. They could be a handful to discipline and train in a garrison setting, but they were tough fighters when battle called.10 <p></p><p></p>That call came on December 23, 1814, at place called Viller�&#x2019;s Plantation. By this time the British had overwhelmed a small force of American gunboats on Lake Borgne, east of New Orleans, and landed a force of about fifteen hundred soldiers at Bayou Bienvenu (which ironically means "welcome" in French) about twenty miles southeast of New Orleans. More would follow later. For now, though, this group began a cautious northward advance in the direction of Ne...</p><h2>Unacknowledged: An Expose of the World&#39;s Greatest Secret</h2><p>The Biggest Lie in History is about to be Shattered.

He is also an avid bluegrass and old-time fiddle player who lives in Roanoke, Virginia, with his wife and daughter.Berrier, an award-winning journalist for the Roanoke Times tells the fascinating story of his grandfather Clayton and great-uncle Saford Hall, two Virginia musicians who were playing bluegrass before the term was even coined. The Halls played together until Saford's death in 1999 (he performed his last gig just months before with the help of oxygen), but it was ultimately the draft that cut their promising career short. Before WWII, the band they were part of had played for thousands, released records, and were heard six days a week on regional radio programs; after the war their careers stalled and the brothers took factory jobs to survive. Berrier writes with an appreciation for Appalachia, a colloquial voice ("There were just too many puissant high school boys catting around"), and nostalgia for how things were in his grandfather's time, "the good old days, which you and I will only know through the stories we inherit." But he's not sentimental, noting the darkness inherent in the stories and music, the "unholy communion of desperation, poverty, hunger and violence" in Depression-era Virginia. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

After all, a "random walk"--in market terms--suggests that a "blindfolded monkey" would have as much luck selecting a portfolio as a pro. But Burton Malkiel's classic investment book is anything but random. Since stock prices cannot be predicted in the short term, argues Malkiel, individual investors are better off buying and holding onto index funds than meddling with securities or actively managing mutual funds. Not only will a broad range of index funds outperform a professionally managed portfolio in the long run, but investors can avoid expense charges and trading costs, which decrease returns.<p> First published in 1973, this seventh printing of a <i>A Random Walk</i> looks forward and does so broadly, examining a new range of investment choices facing the turn-of-the-century investor: money-market accounts, tax-exempt funds, Roth IRAs, and equity REITs, as well as the potential benefits and pitfalls of the emerging global economy. In his updated "life-cycle guide to investing," Malkiel offers age-related investment strategies that consider one's <i>capacity</i> for risk. (A 30-year-old who can depend on wages to offset investment losses has a different risk capacity from a 60-year-old.) In his assessment of rocketing Internet stocks, Malkiel defends his "random" position well, explaining how "the market eventually corrects any irrationality--albeit in its own slow, inexorable fashion. Anomalies can crop up, markets can get irrationally optimistic, and often they attract unwary investors.

A bestselling author of thirteen cookbooks in Greece, she also has her own television series and regularly writes articles for magazines and gives lectures and demonstrations on Greek recipes. She has served on the board of the Centre for the Preservation of Traditional Greek Gastronomy.Alexiadou, a chef well-regarded in Greece for her books and TV series, has compiled recipes from every corner of the country, for every section of the menu, beginning with a delightful array of mezedes such as wine-steamed mussels and fava bean croquettes, then going through soups and salads, pasta, fish and shellfish, all kinds of meats, and baked goods. Though she certainly includes classics like pastitsio, spanakopita and baklava, Alexiadou�s selections overall demonstrate the breadth and depth of Greek cookery with entries such as duckling with kumquats, pumpkin fritters and tangerine flutes. She opens with a brief tour of Greece�s main regions and their specialties, but the focus is more on cooking than chatting; a concise section offering historical tidbits and general instructions opens each chapter, and many recipes close with serving and presentation tips. Alexiadou�s aim is to provide a wide assortment of authentically Greek dishes, bringing the country to life through the recipes� varied ingredients rather than through prose. Some of the ingredients, like <i>colocasia</i>, or sheep�s milk, will be harder for the home cook to obtain than others, but anyone seriously interested in learning the full repertoire of Greek cooking will be willing to make the effort, just as they will want this book. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Just when Josh Redmont has finally stopped worrying about where the money comes from or what it means, a stranger with a foreign accent approaches him on the Fire Island ferry and clues him in. Therein hangs the tale of who's behind Josh good fortune and what kind of bill has come due for all those tax-free dollars. Unbeknownst to our hapless hero, he's been a "sleeper agent" whose paymaster has awakened him just in time to play a big role in a political assassination. How Josh gets out of a mess he had no idea he was in drives the lively narrative to its breathless conclusion. Westlake is the undisputed master of the caper genre--although <i>Money for Nothing</i> may not be as deviously convoluted or sidesplittingly comic as some of his earlier novels (<i>The Ax</i>, <i>Put a Lid On It</i>), it's well worth the reader's attention and appreciation. <i>--Jane Adams</i>Donald E.

It is designed for both quick reference and detailed study. The GEOGRAPHICAL SECTION presents the physical geography of the lands of the biblical world, from Egypt to Mesopotamia. Clear, detailed descriptions will give the reader a vivid picture of regions that are the backdrop of biblical history and that influenced, to a much greater degree than commonly understood, the course of that history. The Israel/Jordan region especially is discussed in depth. The Atlas divides the area into twenty-three natural regions and discusses physical features such as distances, topography, climate, natural lines of communication, soil types, agricultural uses, major sources of water, and role in biblical times. The reader can visualize the various regions with the help of &#39;block diagrams,&#39; which provide a three-dimensional, bird&#39;s-eye view of each region. The HISTORICAL SECTION presents in detail the flow of biblical history in its geographical context and shows how geography influenced the course of biblical history. Each chapter in this section begins with a chronological chart for the period under discussion, allowing the reader to see at a glance how the history of Israel fit into the history of the Ancient Near East as a whole. A separate section on JERUSALEM traces the history and development of the city that is at the center of much of biblical history. A chapter on THE DISCIPLINES OF HISTORICAL GEOGRPAHY shows the reader how the actual sites of ancient cities are rediscovered -- an often complex process that stirs the imagination with the excitement of highly specialized detective work. An outstanding feature of the Zondervan NIV Atlas of the Bible is the GAZETTEER. This is an exhaustive place-name index that gives the exact geographical location for each name with the pages and maps on which the name may be found in the Atlas. In addition it gives a brief biblical/historical summary for each name , with Scripture references, and the modern-day name in Hebrew and/or Arabic. Several appendixes add to the usefulness of the Zondervan NIV Atlas of the Bible. - A two-page CHRONOLOGICAL CHART provides a quick overview of the history of the Ancient Near East. - A GLOSSARY of terms aids the reader in understanding the text without having to resort to dictionaries or encyclopedias. - A BIBLIOGRAPHY provides the reader with suggestions for further, in-depth reading of the study. - A SCRIPTURE INDEX and an INDEX OF PERSONS will aid especially the pastor and teacher. This is why the Zondervan NIV Atlas of the Bible will become the standard by which serious students will measure other Bible atlases.</p><p>Carl Rasmussen (PhD, Dropsie University) was a professor of Old Testament at Bethel University in St. Paul, Minnesota, and an adjunct professor at the Institute of Holy Land Studies in Jerusalem.

What began in a dilapidated former Methodist church building became a spiritual fire that sweep across America and over the Atlantic to much of Great Britain and parts of Europe. Here from the pen of Frank Bartleman, an early participant in the movement, we have an eyewitness account of what many believed was the &#34;Latter Rain&#34; of the Book of Joel. It was the time of high and holy days that stirred not only the Church, but many in the secular world as well. Newspapers across America reported the strange events that were taking place. Out of Azusa Street, new denominations and thousands of churches all over the world were born.</p><p>Power from God <br> <br> Your faith will explode as you read Bartleman's challenging insights into faith&#x2013;filled living from his experiences at Azusa Street. Then you will know how to:<br> <br> * Be an instrument of God's love and healing to others.<br> * Change your life from ordinary to extraordinary.<br> * Conquer fears that have defeated you.<br> * Experience the presence of God for yourself.<br> * Become as effective as the early Christians.<br> <br> Your prayer life will be unbelievably transformed as you experience God's moving in your life.<br> <br> "He who believes in Me, the works that I do he will do also; and greater works than these he will do, because I go to My Father." &#x2013;&#x2013; John 14:12 NKJVFrank Bartleman (1871&#x2013;1936) was an early Pentecostal evangelist who recorded the beginnings of the Pentecostal Movement. He and his wife, Anna, and their family went to Los Angeles in December 1904. Shortly thereafter, their oldest daughter, Esther, who was just three years old, died. This heartbreaking loss made a deep impact on Bartleman and led him to rededicate his life to God's service. He was a participant in the Azusa revival and other early Pentecostal meetings in the Los Angeles area. Bartleman was an itinerant evangelist for 43 years, eventually preaching across the United States and all over the world. He wrote more than 500 articles, 100 tracts, and six books. He is remembered for his passion for increased unity and spiritual renewal among Pentecostals.</p><h2>365 Ways to Cook Hamburger and Other Ground Meats</h2><p>A collection of 365 recipes--one for every day of the year--for hamburger and other ground meats features regional recipes for ground veal, chicken, turkey, lamb, and pork. $40,000 ad/promo.</p><p></p><h2>Vibrant Flowers in Watercolor</h2><p><p><b>Paint Flowers with Feeling</b></p><p>You can paint watercolors that capture the beauty and personality of roses, peonies, zinnias and many more brilliant blooms - and achieve color more vivid than you ever dreamed possible with watercolor.

The real-life model for The Great Gatsby&#x2019;s Meyer Wolfsheim and Nathan Detroit from Guys and Dolls, Rothstein was much more&#x2014;and less&#x2014;than a fixer of baseball games. He was everything that made 1920s Manhattan roar. Featuring Jazz Age Broadway with its thugs, speakeasies, showgirls, political movers and shakers, and stars of the Golden Age of Sports, this is a biography of the man who dominated an age. Arnold Rothstein was a loan shark, pool shark, bookmaker, thief, fence of stolen property, political fixer, Wall Street swindler, labor racketeer, rumrunner, and mastermind of the modern drug trade.

Finally unraveling the mystery of Rothstein&#x2019;s November 1928 murder in a Times Square hotel room, David Pietrusza has cemented The Big Bankroll&#x2019;s place among the most influential and fascinating legendary American criminals. 16 pages of black-and-white photographs are featured.</p><p>Called one "of the best historians in the United States," David Pietrusza has produced a number of critically-acclaimed works concerning 20th century American history.<br><br>His book&nbsp;<i>1960: LBJ vs JFK vs Nixon: The Epic Campaign that Forged Three Presidencies</i>&nbsp;was named by&nbsp;<i>ForeWord Magazine</i>&nbsp;as among the best political biographies.<br><br>Pietrusza's&nbsp;<i>1920: The Year of the Six Presidents</i>&nbsp;received a Kirkus starred review, was honored as a&nbsp;<i>Kirkus</i>&nbsp;"Best Books of 2007"&nbsp;title, and was named an alternate selection of the History Book Club.

ROTHSTEIN is nonstop fiery journalism, finely researched and colorfully written, read with truly impressive panache by the inimitable Grover Gardner. Gardner tears into the material with vigor and intelligence, a knowing insider's edge, and a smirk in each syllable. His style here is reminiscent of period radio announcers, conjuring vivid images of the streets and denizens of old New York in every breath. Be prepared for over fourteen hours of scintillating history that reveals the rampant corruption and indelible characters of the times. Arnold Rothstein grew from a rebellious Jewish boy of the tenements to one of the most influential and conniving criminal minds in history. His intricate rigging of the 1919 World Series was a gem, but Rothstein, clearly an obsessive-compulsive gambling addict, engineered some of the biggest scams, criminal networks, and graft systems ever known in America. Like many of his ilk, his personal life was a tragedy, and Rothstein surely shared the wealth. A must listen, must own audiobook. D.J.B.

The only European city in which both the Allies and the Axis power operated openly, it was temporary home to much of Europe's exiled royalty, over one million refugees seeking passage to the U.S., and a host of spies, secret police, captains of industry, bankers, prominent Jews, writers and artists, escaped POWs, and black marketeers. An operations officer writing in 1944 described the daily scene at Lisbon's airport as being like the movie Casablanca,&#x201d; times twenty.<p> In this riveting narrative, renowned historian Neill Lochery draws on his relationships with high-level Portuguese contacts, access to records recently uncovered from Portuguese secret police and banking archives, and other unpublished documents to offer a revelatory portrait of the War's back stage. And he tells the story of how Portugal, a relatively poor European country trying frantically to remain neutral amidst extraordinary pressures, survived the war not only physically intact but significantly wealthier. The country's emergence as a prosperous European Union nation would be financed in part, it turns out, by a cache of Nazi gold.</p></p><p><b>Neill Lochery, PhD</b>, is a world-renowned source on Israel, the Middle East, and Mediterranean history.

In this collection of mostly nineteenth-century folk and fairy tales, Ethel Johnston Phelps's heroines successfully portray women as being spirited, courageous and smart. This type of heroine is not easily found in most collections; in most traditional folk and fairy tales we encounter women are portrayed as being good, obedient, submissive, and, of course, beautiful. These women&#x2014;and girls&#x2014;are resourceful; they take action to solve a problem and use cleverness or shrewd common sense to solve the dilemmas they face.<br><br>The tales themselves are part of an oral tradition that document a generation according to the values of the time.

They can be the key to our success or the reason for our downfall. So, how do we harness that power? How do we learn to use our words to their greatest potential?

After working as an assistant to Diego Rivera on the ill-fated Rockefeller Center mural, he began creating his own arresting murals--in Washington, New York, and New Jersey--which are among the finest such works ever painted in this country. He also excelled as a photographer as one of the distinguished group known as the FSA photographers, which included Dorothea Lange and his close friend Walker Evans. His life&nbsp;&nbsp;crossed the paths of many others, too, including Albert Einstein, Alexander Calder, William Carlos Williams, Archibald MacLeish, and S. J. Perelman.<br><br>During World War II, he produced some of the most striking and effective propaganda posters, before returning again to painting, always choosing subjects that touched a nerve and were just as often politically powerful.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Shahn also entered the world of advertising, but completely on his own terms, and was respected for it. His life was always involved directly with his times, and he was a member of the intellectual community throughout his career, as well as a courageous political activist. His unique, unforgettable work won him shows in museums all over America, including the Museum of Modern&nbsp;&nbsp;Art.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Ben Shahn is the first complete life of the artist, and it is illustrated throughout with his photographs, pictures, and paintings.</p><p>There was a time when nearly everyone recognized Ben Shahn's scathing pictures from his most famous series, <i>The Passion of Sacco and Vanzetti</i>, 1932. Sacco and Vanzetti, two working-class anarchists convicted on trumped-up murder charges, lie dead in their coffins. Behind them stand the top-hatted men of the old, Anglo establishment, hypocritically mourning the poor immigrants whose lives they destroyed. <p> These days, it may be hard to understand how vital such storytelling artists were to the political life of their times. In <i>Ben Shahn: An Artist's Life</i>, Howard Greenfeld does justice to those heady days, placing both Shahn and his work in the context of the Great Depression, the rise of unions and social relief programs, and the beginnings of the civil rights movement. With uncommon fairness, Greenfeld also chronicles the difficult, contradictory personal life of this brilliant artist, who, for example, began and ended his career working on Jewish themes but cruelly abandoned his first wife, Tillie, and their two children to marry a Christian woman. </p><p> Greenfeld adeptly traces Shahn's development as one of the 20th century's most important illustrators and narrative artists, comparable to Daumier and even to Goya. Carefully researched, this biography is simultaneously respectful and objective. Greenfeld, who has also written biographies of Puccini, Caruso, and art collector Albert C. Barnes, has a gift for seeing a densely complicated life as an understandable, admirable whole. <i>--Peggy Moorman</i></p><b>Howard Greenfeld</b> is the author of three acclaimed biographies--of Puccini, Caruso, and the art collector Albert C. Barnes. Greenfeld was also the founder of Orion Press. He lived in France and Italy for many years, where he published English-language translations of such writers as Italo Calvino, Primo Levi, and Jean Piaget. There, he became friendly with Shahn in the last years of the artist's life. As a result of this friendship, Shahn's wife, Bernarda, herself an artist, agreed to allow Greenfeld access to her memories and mementos of Shahn.&nbsp;&nbsp; Howard Greenfeld lives in New York City.</p><h2>The Wages of Sin: A Novel (Sarah Gilchrist Mysteries)</h2><p><p><strong>A page-turning tale of murder, subversion and vice in which a&nbsp;female medical student in Victorian Edinburgh is drawn into a murder investigation when she recognizes one of the corpses in her anatomy lecture.</strong></p> Sarah Gilchrist has fled London and a troubled past to join the University of Edinburgh's medical school in 1892, the first year it admits women. She is determined to become a doctor despite the misgivings of her family and society, but Sarah quickly finds plenty of barriers at school itself: professors who refuse to teach their new pupils, male students determined to force out their female counterparts, and&#x2015;perhaps worst of all&#x2015;her female peers who will do anything to avoid being associated with a fallen woman.<br><br> Desperate for a proper education, Sarah turns to one of the city&#x2019;s ramshackle charitable hospitals for additional training. The St Giles&#x2019; Infirmary for Women ministers to the downtrodden and drunk, the thieves and whores with nowhere else to go. In this environment, alongside a group of smart and tough teachers, Sarah gets quite an education. But when Lucy, one of Sarah&#x2019;s patients, turns up in the university dissecting room as a battered corpse, Sarah finds herself drawn into a murky underworld of bribery, brothels, and body snatchers.<br><br> Painfully aware of just how little separates her own life from that of her former patient&#x2019;s, Sarah is determined to find out what happened to Lucy and bring those responsible for her death to justice. But as she searches for answers in Edinburgh&#x2019;s dank alleyways, bawdy houses and fight clubs, Sarah comes closer and closer to uncovering one of Edinburgh&#x2019;s most lucrative trades, and, in doing so, puts her own life at risk...<br><br> An irresistible read with a fantastic heroine, beautifully drawn setting, fascinating insights into what it was like to study medicine as a woman at that time, <em>The Wages of Sin</em> is a stunning debut that heralds a striking new voice in historical fiction.<br></p><p>Kaite Welsh,&nbsp;author of The Wages of Sin,&nbsp;is an Edinburgh-based journalist and the literature officer at Creative Scotland.

Damp, sooty, moralistic, and sinning Edinburgh is convincingly evoked.

An exhilarating and atmospheric mystery set mostly in the gas-lit streets of Edinburgh.

She is the founder of the Barbara Sinatra Children's Center, and she devotes much of her personal and professional energy to numerous philanthropies. A proud mother and grandmother, Barbara lives in California.<br>The widow of Frank Sinatra delivers the goods in this intimate memoir of their years together, filled with parties, recordings, career hurdles, concerts, travels, and triumphs. Barbara Blakeley was "just a farm girl from Missouri," who became a model, a Vegas showgirl, and the wife of Zeppo Marx, and mingled with celebrities in L.A., Vegas, and Palm Springs. At a Sinatra dinner party for the first time, she felt "there was definitely a frisson between us." With her own marriage crumbling, she made plans to meet Sinatra in Monaco: "Was I about to be seduced by one of the world's greatest romantics?" That idyllic summer "turned into night after glorious night of romance in some of the most glamorous venues in Europe." After "five years of flirting and courting," Barbara and Frank Sinatra married in 1976, and it was the longest of his four marriages. They stayed together for 22 years, until his death in 1998. Probing Sinatra's personality, she contrasts his polite manners and loyalty to friends with his feuds and booze-induced rants. Yet in the end, as she sees it, "Frank was, without doubt, the most romantic man I had ever met," and that feeling permeates the pages throughout. (Mar. 1) <br>(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

Unable to fathom the idea of returning home, she remains in this unfamiliar city, living in a commune, without friends or family, on the brink of destitution. She finally acts on a passion she has kept secret for years: mastering the violin. Leda is seduced by the music that underscores life in the city: tango, born from lower-class immigrant voices, now the illicit, scandalous dance of brothels and cabarets. Leda knows, however, that she can never play in public as a woman, so she cuts off her hair, binds her breasts, and, as a young man, joins a troupe of musicians bent on bringing tango into the salons of high society.

Francesca had warned her very clearly to head right down the block to the stores and vendors, then return quickly home. But she was starved to see more of the city. The conventillo caged her in. She hadn&#x2019;t planned to break the rules and stray, but, after filling her basket with loaves from Alfonso Di Bacco, who extolled her beauty and dispensed paternal advice as he had come to do each day&#x2014;<i>where there&#x2019;s life, there&#x2019;s hope&#x2014;choose neither linen nor a man by candlelight&#x2014;the best word is the one that goes unspoken</i>&#x2014;she stood at the corner and stared down the block at unknown buildings, unseen doors and rooms and lives, carriages pulled by horses clopclopping their way to places they knew and she did not, their manes gleaming in the late sun before they dove into shadows, and she thought, what harm can it do to walk a little in the light of day? Can it really be so dangerous? She set out down the block, crossed the street and kept walking. People, streaming everywhere, women in doorways, old men in caf�s or pushing ramshackle handcarts, calling out not in Italian, but in Spanish, that strange language that sounded like the Italian of an alternate planet. A planet of drunkards, perhaps. Already she understood more glimmers of it, which meant she was either learning Spanish or getting drunk on this place, or both. The streets were crowded with people, innumerable people who&#x2019;d arrived before her to the land of promise and already staked their space. Land of promise you have promised too much already to the thousands. She walked on. Her ear caught shreds of other languages. She heard a woman in a doorway speaking sounds unlike anything she&#x2019;d heard before, at once angular and melodic. For all she knew it could be the tongue of demons or the gods. Further on, children called to their mothers from inside the house, in Spanish, Italian, another unknown tongue. Two girls with baskets walked purposefully past her, gossiping in French. At a caf�, an old man told a joke in the Neapolitan dialect to a group of men who laughed appreciatively. More Napoletanos. She had imagined, in her brief visit to Naples, that that would be all she&#x2019;d see of the city, but Naples had followed her across the ocean. It surrounded her. It had invaded Buenos Aires. And isn&#x2019;t that strange, she thought, the way one city can swirl inside another; the way you can be in one country yet carry another country in your skin; the way a place is changed by whoever comes to it, the way silt invades the body of a river. She was that, a speck of silt. The thought thrilled her but it also made her want to weep without reason, or for reasons utterly unknown to her. With every immigrant she passed she longed to stop and stare into his or her face and ask with nothing but her gaze <i>And you? What are you here for? Why did you come?</i>, as though just looking at them might unlatch the trapdoor to their hidden stories. And the stories would be infinite, no two alike, burning with hope and loss and vigorous despair, told in more dialects than even God could possibly speak, and yet, she suddenly saw, it was possible that somewhere beneath the surface all their hidden stories held the same thread, a single hum of longing, <i>I came to live. </i>Surely this was true for all of them, including her. And Buenos Aires, tell me, is there any chance that I can forge a space for myself somewhere in the folds of you? (She turned a corner and kept walking.) Will I ever rove these raucous streets with familiarity and with no fear? She walked and walked. The thrum of her feet, the thrum of the city. She felt hypnotized, expanded, and all the things around her&#x2014;doors, people, brightly painted walls&#x2014;threatened to tear her open with their sheer existence. She had never felt more awake in her life. The voices of the city blended and poured into her, filling her up, radiant, sweetly fatal, and that was when she understood that whatever this city was, whatever it held, she wanted it. All of it. She wanted Buenos Aires inside her, around her, covering her skin like a film of sweat. She wanted the breath of this city in her lungs no matter the danger, no matter the other story about the good girl who stays locked inside with needle and thread until she can get back to her home village, to hell with that story, she wanted freedom, wanted to taste this place even if it killed her. She felt exhilarated and afraid of her own exhilaration. Was she going mad? Cora, is this how it was for you? She stopped, leaned against a wall, and closed her eyes. Her mind warred between collecting itself and falling even deeper into thrall.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Se�orita?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She opened her eyes. A man stood before her, hat in hand. He had a kind enough face but his gaze was too raw. He said something in Spanish that she did not understand. Then he smiled and placed his hand on her arm. Her skin prickled. She tried to pull away, but his hand followed and gripped her tightly.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leda tore away from him and ran. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was lost. One turn, two, and she was on a block she&#x2019;d never seen before. Old men played dice on the sidewalk, bickering in a strident Italian. They spoke her language but now she was afraid to ask for help, and the thought pushed in before she could stop it, <i>I want my Mamma, Mamma where are you? </i>But Mamma was not here, she was unreachable, twenty steamship days away across a great blue ocean of impossible. She tried going the other way. Her arm ached from the basket&#x2019;s weight, she shifted it to the other side and kept walking and walking until she reached the end of a street that let out to the port, and there she saw the ships and cargo, men working high up on ladders, hauling crates, sweat beading on their faces, and one of them&#x2014;Dante! Her cousin, her husband!&#x2014;turned as if to call to her, but no, he was not Dante, his gaze moved blankly on and he wiped his face and resumed his burden. Dante was dead and did not work here anymore. You are alone, Leda. Alone. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It took her another hour to find her way home. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Where were you?&#x201d; Francesca scolded as soon as she arrived. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t just wander around this city. You don&#x2019;t know what happens to women out there.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That night, Leda couldn&#x2019;t sleep. She tossed and turned, feverish with thoughts. She thought of the city, pulsing beyond the walls of her conventillo, bursting with life and noise and peril. The thought of Dante and the moment at the port: it was him, it was not him, he would never be at the port again. His absence stabbed her. She wondered what he&#x2019;d felt when he&#x2019;d walked the streets she walked today. Whether they&#x2019;d amazed him as they had her. She longed to ask him. Longed to close the gap between his life and hers.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She went to the armoire and opened its doors for the first time. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His clothes were all there, as promised. Musty air welled toward her, tinged with the scent of mothballs, dry sweat, and decay. At first, she touched the clothing with trepidation, not wanting to disturb its sleep; but then she found herself taking out a pair of trousers, a shirt, a vest, a jacket. She laid them on the bed in the shape of a man. They were empty clothes, nothing more. She touched them again. How had they felt against his skin? And then, before her mind could ask her body what it was doing, she was taking off her nightgown and putting on the shirt, trousers, vest, in an act that would surely scandalize the living if not the dead. Her hips slipped smoothly into the trousers. Her body flushed with hot alarm. What if someone walked into her room now? No, that would not happen. No one ever walked into her room after she retired for the night. Still she could not shake the sense of an unutterable danger. Dante, can you forgive me? Am I violating your memory, or paying it tribute? <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was shocking, how comfortably his clothes fit. The shirt swelled a little over her breasts. It felt strange to have two layers of fabric between her thighs. How different it must be to walk with the sheath of trousers between your legs rather than a crowd of petticoats rustling around them. She tried it, stalking the room, hesitantly at first, then more boldly, imagining how Dante might have strode on his way to work in the mornings, full of muscle and determination, full of hope. And if he passed another man he would not modestly bow his head and avert his eyes, but rather nod to him, chin high, shoulders squared against the world. Wasn&#x2019;t that how men did it? She wasn&#x2019;t sure. She knew how it looked from the outside, this walk of men, but not how it felt from within. She tried it, walked an imaginary street, passed an imaginary man, nodded, not slow-forehead-down, as women do, but quick-chin-up. She felt preposterous, but she also felt something else: a delectable rush. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She took the clothes off, quickly, then stared at them, bunched on the floor. What had she done? She would never do that again. In that instant, with all her soul, she swore that she never would.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She broke the vow the following night. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This time, she put the clothes on slowly, buttoning with fingers still sore from a day&#x2019;s sewing. Then she looked at herself in a hand-mirror, tilting it up and down her body in the lamplight. She looked like a man. She felt like a man&#x2014;or, at least, she felt the way she imagined a man might feel: emboldened, like she could walk all the way to the end of her neighborhood and people would leave her alone. Like she could walk into a caf� in the middle of the night and the barman would serve her, casually, like she was just a normal customer, like all she was asking for was a damn drink. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But she was not a man. She was a woman. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wasn&#x2019;t she?<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What kind of woman does this thing you&#x2019;re doing right now?</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The question rose out of the air and coiled around her. She didn&#x2019;t want to think about the answer but she also didn&#x2019;t want to take off Dante&#x2019;s clothes. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>You should take them off. You disgusting girl. Take them off. </i><br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>She stood still for a long time. Something broke apart inside her. She sensed that the longer the clothes stayed on her body, the more irreparable the change would become. And yet she made no move to take the clothes off. Instead her hands reached for the instrument case and took out the violin. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She played.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The moves were becoming more familiar to her hands. With men&#x2019;s clothes on, her hands moved more smoothly, with more strength and confidence, and this surprised her. It was difficult to keep silent&#x2014;she longed to hear the motion of her fingers, to test the quality of her sound. But she did not break the silence; the silence was her shield, her refuge. And soon her fingers&#x2019; music filled her mind and drowned out the hostile voice that had demanded she take the clothes off. The voice slunk into the corners of the room, where it crouched, shrunken in momentary defeat, helpless in the face of silent music.</p><h2>The Lure of the North Woods: Cultivating Tourism in the Upper Midwest</h2><p><p><br>In the late nineteenth century, the North Woods offered people little in the way of a pleasant escape. Rather, it was a hub of production supplying industrial America with vast quantities of lumber and mineral ore. This book tells the story of how northern Minnesota, northern Wisconsin, and Michigan&#x2019;s Upper Peninsula became a tourist paradise, turning a scarred countryside into the playground we know today.</p><br><p>Stripped of much of its timber and ore by the early 1900s, the North Woods experienced deindustrialization earlier than the Rust Belt cities that consumed its resources. In <i>The Lure of the North Woods</i>, Aaron Shapiro describes how residents and visitors reshaped the region from a landscape of exploitation to a vacationland. The rejuvenating North Woods profited in new ways by drawing on emerging connections between the urban and the rural, including improved transportation, promotion, recreational land use, and conservation initiatives. Shapiro demonstrates how this transformation helps explain the interwar origins of modern American environmentalism, when both the consumption of nature for pleasure and the work of the Civilian Conservation Corps in the North Woods and elsewhere led many Americans to cultivate a fresh perspective on the outdoors. At a time when travel and recreation are considered major economic forces, <i>The Lure of the North Woods</i> reveals how leisure&#x2014;and tourism in particular&#x2014;has shaped modern America.<br></p></p><p><p><br>Aaron Shapiro, a Chicago native and North Woods visitor since his youth, is assistant professor of history at Auburn University. He previously served as national historian for the USDA Forest Service in Washington, D.C., and as assistant director of the Scholl Center for Family and Community History at Chicago&#x2019;s Newberry Library.<br></p>"<i>The Lure of the North Woods</i> is likely to become the definitive history of tourism in the twentieth century Midwest, and a landmark in the history of modern tourism in the United States. Prodigiously researched and engagingly written, this book interweaves the stories of environmental pioneers, governmental officials, tourist promoters, and property owners whose efforts created a vacation playground in the North Woods."&nbsp;&#x2014;Susan Sessions Rugh, author of <i>Are We There Yet? The Golden Age of American Family Vacations</i><br><br><br>"When someone from the Midwest says they are going on vacation &#x2018;Up North,&#x2019; they mean the North Woods&#x2014;the forests and lakes of northern Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. But as Aaron Shapiro shows in this insightful book, the region has not always been a tourists&#x2019; paradise. Shapiro demonstrates how the recreational needs of tourists, the economic needs of resort owners, and the organizational needs of experts converged to create one of the Midwest&#x2019;s most cherished landscapes, exploring the intertwined roles of work and leisure, nature and culture, place and identity."&nbsp;&#x2014;Jim Feldman, University of Wisconsin, Oshkosh<br></p><h2>Whittaker Chambers: A Biography</h2><p>Primarily known as the accuser of Alger Hiss, Whittaker Chambers was a commanding, complex figure who was center stage during many of the public events of his time, yet remained intensely private. This book covers Chambers&#39; personal life, as well as his emergence as a dominant voice in the postwar ant-Communist movement. 16 pp. of photos. 640 pp. Print ads. Author tour. 35,000 print.</p><p>A coolly objective look at the most controversial figure in the postwar crusade against American Communists. Whittaker Chambers (1901-61) made headlines in 1948 with his sensational accusation that former State Department official Alger Hiss was not only a Communist, but a spy, charges Hiss denied until his death in 1996. This scrupulously evenhanded biography concludes that Chambers told the truth, even as it pitilessly delineates his tortured family background, anguished sexual confusion, and political ruthlessness, which might well prompt doubts about his trustworthiness. Chambers&#39; life makes a perfect case study of the most morally fraught period in American history.SAM TANENHAUS is the editor of both the <i>New York Times Book Review</i> and the ''Week in Review'' section of the <i>Times</i>.

In 1999, his script for the documentary <i>The Story of Golf</i> was nominated for an Emmy Award. He lives in St. Andrews, Scotland.<b><p>Chapter One: The Slice of My Life</p><p></p></b><p></p><p>It was a ghastly, careening push-slice -- the mongrel of all golf shots -- that changed the course of my life. Okay, maybe that's a bit breathless, but there's no question that the banana ball I perpetrated on July 16, 1983, was the finest shot I've ever missed.</p><p></p><p>The scene was the 18th tee of the most famous golf course in the world, the Old Course at St. Andrews, Scotland. As the editor-in-chief of <i>Golf Magazine,</i> I'd been invited, along with half a dozen or so colleagues from other American golf publications and newspapers, on a pre-British Open boondoggle, courtesy of a man named Frank Sheridan.</p><p></p><p>Sheridan had purchased the Old Course Hotel, the modern five-story monster that looms inharmoniously over the penultimate hole of the ancient links, the balconies of its sixty deluxe rooms jutting impudently outward from a chunky stucco frame. When the hotel first opened, back in 1968, Henry Longhurst aptly described it as "a dresser with its drawers pulled out," and despite its advantageous location, the place had never really caught on.</p><p></p><p>Sheridan, however, was determined to transform the hotel (which he'd rechristened the Old Course Golf &amp; Country Club) into Scotland's premier hostelry, and to help make his point he'd drafted Jack Nicklaus and Seve Ballesteros to launch a weekend-long celebration with a head-to-head match on the Old Course, to be reported upon by us conscripted scribes.</p><p></p><p>But at the eleventh hour, there arose what the Scots refer to as a wee glitch. Commandeering a tee time on the Old Course is not a simple matter, even if your names are Nicklaus and Ballesteros. The St. Andrews Links Trust -- which controls play on all six of the town's courses -- had ruled that Sheridan's circus would not come to town -- it would create too much disruption to the regular Saturday morning play. And so, rather hastily, the battle of the titans had been relegated to Ladybank, a comparatively unknown parkland course in a nearby town of the same name.</p><p></p><p>"It's just down the road -- you'll see the sign," said the hotel porter on the appointed morning as I headed out the door to my rental car along with <i>Golf Digest's</i> Ross Goodner, Ron Coffman of <i>Golf World,</i> and Furman Bisher, the venerable and feisty sports columnist for the <i>Atlanta Constitution.</i></p><p></p><p>Down the road Ladybank was, but a bit farther down the road than we'd expected. We'd driven roughly ten miles, all four of us craning our necks at every little sign, placard, and poster, when Bisher boomed from the back seat, "Aw hell, why don't we just forget about it and go play some golf."</p><p></p><p>It was an offer none of us could refuse. And so, approximately 300 yards short of the intersection I now know to be signposted "Ladybank," I U-turned my Vauxhall Viva and headed back to St. Andrews.</p><p></p><p>Up to the first tee of the Old Course we marched and lo and behold there was an open slot. Today this would never happen, and even back in July of 1983 it was relatively astounding. What was even more remarkable, however, was that upon learning of our good fortune, all four underpaid and overprivileged members of the golf media immediately reached into our pockets and not only paid to play but sprung for caddies. (My colleagues, I assumed, had the same intention I had -- to do some creative writing at expense account time.)</p><p></p><p>Four blissful hours later, we were tramping back into the lobby of the hotel, bags over our shoulders, when suddenly we found ourselves the focus of some highly unwanted attention. There, in the center of the lobby, standing in a semicircle and looking directly at us, were Nicklaus, Ballesteros, and Sheridan, in the middle of a press conference with our invited colleagues, including the BBC, with its klieg lights glaring and cameras rolling. Absolutely horror-struck, I moved into "perp walk" mode, shoulders hunched, head bowed, hand shading brow.</p><p></p><p>Old Furman had no such compunctions. Striding straight up to Nicklaus, he said, "Jack, we're awfully sorry we didn't come to watch you boys down at Ladybank, but you see, we were able to get a tee time on the Old Course!"</p><p></p><p>It was during that illicit round that I hit the fateful slice of my life. Understand now, the home hole at the Home of Golf lies seamlessly side by side with the opening hole, comprising a target the approximate breadth and contour of Nebraska. But as any devout golfer knows, the Old Course is not just a golf course, it's a shrine -- golf's version of the Vatican -- and number 18 is its culmination, its Sistine Chapel, the last place you want to demonstrate a proclivity to stray.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, running along the entire right edge of the hole is a sturdy, gleaming white fence, marking out of bounds, and just beyond that fence, across a narrow street, is a row of stately slate-roofed townhouses, their bulging bay-windowed facades adding considerably to the intimidation of the final tee shot. Yes, when a golfer puts his peg in the ground at number 18 on the Old, every fiber in his being tells him "Don't go right."</p><p></p><p>Which of course I did, with a swing so convulsive that, from the moment the ball left the clubface all four players and all four caddies knew it was gone, destined for not grass but glass -- or steel or granite or human flesh or some calamitous combination of them all.</p><p></p><p>Curiously, however, it just disappeared, diving without bounce or clank into the nether regions of the gray stone neighborhood. I never found that ball. But while searching for it I did find something else -- a For Sale sign. Incredibly, the bottom two floors of one of those townhouses -- 2,000 square feet of private residence -- was on the market, and fate had drawn me (actually sliced me) to it.</p><p></p><p>On Monday morning, instead of heading down to Birkdale with my cohorts, I phoned the listing broker and asked the price. When I heard it, my heart skipped a beat -- �45,000, or about $65,000 at the then prevailing exchange rate. The previous owner, an elderly woman, had died earlier that year and left everything in the hands of lawyers and accountants who had been instructed to accept the first offer to hit the asking price. In six weeks, no such offer had been received.</p><p></p><p>I took a quick walk through the place and that evening called home for permission. My wife, although a confirmed nongolfer, had been to St. Andrews and I knew she liked the town.</p><p></p><p>"The interior's not in great shape," I said, "but that's okay -- the layout is ideal, the rooms are big, the ceilings are high, and there are four working fireplaces. Besides, we're never going to actually live here -- it's an investment. We can rent it to students to help with the carrying costs, and in the summers it'll be free if we want to visit. I know it's a chunk out of our savings, honey, but wait until you see the view."</p><p></p><p>Happily, she didn't need much selling. And so, two months later in a solicitor's office in Dundee, George and Libby Peper became the proud owners of 9A Gibson Place, St. Andrews, Fife.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Copyright � 2006 by George Peper</p><p></p><p></p></p><h2>Crossfire</h2><p><b>An exhilarating new novel from the <i>New York Times</i>-bestselling authors. </b> <br><br> Shell-shocked and missing a foot-lost to an IED during his tour of duty in Afghanistan-Captain Tom Forsyth has been sent "home" by the army and, at loose ends, returns to his estranged mother's house for the first time since he joined up at seventeen.

He lives in England.Martin Jarvis and Dick Francis have been a winning combination for some time, and this latest and last (Francis died recently) is no exception. Back from Afghanistan minus a foot, Tom Forsyth discovers that his mother, a prominent racehorse trainer, is being blackmailed. His investigation and a budding romance give him a new purpose in life. Jarvis&#39;s vocal characterizations are beyond wonderful, especially the mother, a haughty harridan who mellows, and the stiff-upper-lip industrialist who aids Tom. There&#39;s also a stableful of other friends and foes. The characters&#39; various British accents enliven a gripping story. One can hear Tom&#39;s developing maturity and self-confidence as he calls on his military training to outwit the blackmailers. Let&#39;s hope Francis&#39;s son, Felix, will carry on the family tradition. J.B.G.

Bill Gates, Bono, and Laura Bush are only a few of the personalities who have lent their names&#x2014;and opened their pocketbooks&#x2014;in hopes of curing the disease. Still, in a time when every emergent disease inspires waves of panic, why aren&#x2019;t we doing more to eradicate one of our oldest foes? And how does a parasitic disease that we&#x2019;ve known how to prevent for more than a century still infect 500 million people every year, killing nearly 1 million of them?<br><br>In <i>The Fever</i>, the journalist Sonia Shah sets out to answer these questions, delivering a timely, inquisitive chronicle of the illness and its influence on human lives. Through the centuries, she finds, we&#x2019;ve invested our hopes in a panoply of drugs and technologies, and invariably those hopes have been dashed. From the settling of the New World to the construction of the Panama Canal, through wars and the advances of the Industrial Revolution, Shah tracks malaria&#x2019;s jagged ascent and the tragedies in its wake, revealing a parasite every bit as persistent as the insects that carry it.

While my cousins snore on the bed mats</p><p>laid across the floor beside me, glistening bodies bathed in the warm</p><p>night breeze, my sleeping mat is ensconced in a hot, gauzy cage. The</p><p>mosquitoes descend from the darkened corners of the whitewashed</p><p>room and perch menacingly on the taut netting, ready to exploit any</p><p>fl icker of movement from their prey within. It is hard to fall asleep</p><p>knowing they are there, watching me, but eventually I drop off and</p><p>my tensed body uncurls. They sneak into the gaps my protruding</p><p>limbs create, and feast.</p><p>In the morning, all my hard work of trying to fi t in, to overcome</p><p>the Americanness of my suburban New England life, has been</p><p>undone, for my Indian cousins are smooth and brown while I am</p><p>speckled with bleeding scabs. My grandmother vigorously pats talcum</p><p>powder over my wounds, the white powder caking pink with</p><p>congealed blood, as my cousins snicker. I don&#x2019;t understand how they</p><p>escape unscathed while I am tormented. But incomprehension is part </p><p>of the package of these childhood summers in India. Just outside my</p><p>grandmother&#x2019;s house ragged families huddle in rubble along the road</p><p>and use the train tracks as their toilet. They wave their sticklike arms</p><p>in my face and moan woefully when we pass by on the way to temple,</p><p>caricatures of beggars. One boy&#x2019;s leg has swollen to the size of a log,</p><p>and is gray and pimpled, from some disease brought on by a mosquito</p><p>bite. My grandmother tightens her grip on my hand. We give</p><p>the children nothing. I can&#x2019;t understand this, either. When we get to</p><p>the white marble temple, it is full of incense and golden statues</p><p>encrusted with diamonds and rubies&#x2014;to my seven-year-old mind,</p><p>the very picture of prosperity.</p><p>Part of me despises my estrangement, my incomprehension, the</p><p>fact that I must sleep under the suffocating net and take the malaria</p><p>pills while my cousins don&#x2019;t. But part of me is secretly glad. The boy</p><p>with the swollen leg frightens me. The family who lives on the curb</p><p>frightens me. India frightens me. These fears, for the girl who is supposed</p><p>to be Indian but isn&#x2019;t, are unspeakable.</p><p>When no one is looking, I crush the mosquitoes&#x2019; poised little</p><p>figures with my palm and smear the remains on a hidden seam in</p><p>the couch. Our Jain religion forbids violence of any kind. No eating</p><p>meat. No swatting flies. My grandmother wears a mask over her</p><p>mouth while she prays, to protect airborne microbes from inadvertent</p><p>annihilation in her inhalations, and considers walking on</p><p>blades of grass a sin. Meanwhile, there I am in the corner, cravenly</p><p>pulverizing mosquito corpses behind my back, blood literally on</p><p>my hands.</p><p>Back home in New England, the mosquitoes still bite, but there</p><p>are no nets at night, no pills to take, no scary beggars on the side of</p><p>the road. We shop for forgettable plastic trinkets at the mall. My fear</p><p>and loathing of the mosquito are blunted into games of tag. My father</p><p>calls himself Giant Mosquito, undulates his fingers like proboscises</p><p>and chases me and my sister. It&#x2019;s scary, but fun-scary. We screech</p><p>with glee and stampede through the house. </p><p>� � �</p><p>Thirty years later, on the S-shaped land bridge between the North</p><p>and South American continents, I meet Jos� Calzada. Calzada is a</p><p>mosquito stalker of sorts, and I, the mosquito hater, have come to</p><p>learn about the local mosquitoes and their exploits. A parasitologist</p><p>from Panama City, Panama, Calzada spends his time rushing to the</p><p>scene of disease outbreaks across the isthmus. The mosquito-borne</p><p>parasite that causes malaria, <em>Plasmodium</em>, is one of his specialties.</p><p>It is April 2006. For most of the past century, there hasn&#x2019;t been</p><p>much work in this fi eld for people such as Calzada. Panama prides</p><p>itself on being one of just a handful of tropical developing countries</p><p>to have tamed its mosquitoes and nearly conquered malaria. American</p><p>military engineers built a canal through Panama in the early</p><p>1900s, and forced malaria to retreat to the remote fringes of the</p><p>country. Since then it has stagnated, primarily in its most benign</p><p>incarnation, vivax malaria, which is rarely fatal.</p><p>But things have changed in recent years, and Calzada has agreed</p><p>to show me some obscure signs. He emerges from the imposing</p><p>Gorgas Memorial Institute, Panama&#x2019;s sole health research center.</p><p>Clean-shaven and trim, Calzada has a slightly worried look in his</p><p>eyes that is off set by high cheekbones suggesting a perpetual halfsmile.</p><p>I wait while he meticulously changes out of his work clothes&#x2014;</p><p>button-down oxford shirt and slacks&#x2014;and into a T-shirt and jeans.</p><p>Climbing into my diminutive white rental car and tossing a baseball</p><p>cap on top of his backpack in the backseat, he patiently directs me</p><p>out of the labyrinthine metropolis. Navigating Panama City&#x2019;s congested</p><p>streets, past shiny skyscrapers and packed caf�s, is a task that</p><p>challenges even my well-honed Boston driv ing skills.</p><p>After twenty minutes heading east out of the city, the road turns</p><p>quiet. It&#x2019;s a lovely drive, with hills in the distance, verdant pasture</p><p>and scrub unbroken save for a few elaborately gated houses set far</p><p>back from the road. Colombian drug lords, Calzada says, by way of </p><p>explanation. Another hour passes, and the road rises, a glittering</p><p>lake coming into view, just visible through a tangle of jungle. As we</p><p>near the water, the pavement ends, and we pull over.</p><p>Here, at the end of the road, is the town of Chepo. From what I</p><p>can see, it consists of a wooden lean-to facing a sleepy roadside caf�.</p><p>Two police officers amble out of the lean-to, which turns out to be a</p><p>checkpoint. They take my passport and vanish, leaving Calzada and</p><p>me to buy a cold drink at the near-empty caf�. As we sit, I can just</p><p>make them out in the murk within the lean-to, inspecting the blue</p><p>passport with great care, turning it over and over in their hands as if</p><p>for clues to some baffling mystery.</p><p>Inspection completed, Calzada leads us on foot behind the road.</p><p>Th e hillside is green and lush, with a slick red clay track leading to</p><p>the crest. He heads up and I follow gingerly.</p><p>At the top of the hill lies an improb able settlement. Packed</p><p>together, not ten feet apart, are dozens of hand-built ranchos, their</p><p>thatched roofs sitting on top of roughly hewn wooden poles. More</p><p>arbor than hut, some of the structures rest on concrete slabs, with</p><p>airy wooden-slat walls on three sides, but most are fully open-air,</p><p>situated directly on the packed dirt. Inside the ranchos, smoldering</p><p>fi res are encircled by battered metal cooking vats, parrots sit on overturned</p><p>baskets, and hammocks sway from high rafters.</p><p>From the road, Chepo seems abandoned, but in fact, three hundred</p><p>of Panama&#x2019;s indigenous Kuna people live here, tucked away.</p><p>It starts to rain, and we duck under the eaves of a rancho. Women</p><p>pass to and fro in bright puff ed-sleeve cotton blouses with patterned </p><p><em>molas </em>tied around their waists and elaborate beaded anklets that</p><p>reach up to their calves. They are cutting plantains, carrying plump</p><p>naked children. One puts out a giant metal vat to collect the rainwater</p><p>sliding off the thatch. A rooster strides by purposefully.</p><p>A half-dozen boys clad in saggy cotton underwear and wearing</p><p>shell necklaces happily kick a defl ated green soccer ball. One boy,</p><p>around eight years old and wearing cracked red plastic flip-flops,</p><p>gnaws on a green mango pit while absentmindedly pulling on his </p><p>penis. A little girl walks by holding a baby covered in a rash, whom</p><p>she hands to me easily. It is a tranquil scene, earthy and ripe, this</p><p>hidden place at the end of the road.</p><p>It is soon apparent that most of the residents are in one of the</p><p>larger ranchos, sitting around a smoky fire. Peeking in, we see them</p><p>singing softly and dancing. A few are sprawled on the clay floor,</p><p>facedown, passed out. We&#x2019;ve arrived in the midst of a fiesta, Calzada</p><p>whispers to me. A local girl has recently menstruated for the fi rst</p><p>time, and so the community has spent the day drinking <em>chicha fuerte</em>,</p><p>a brew made from fermented corn. As we watch, a woman and a</p><p>boy lift a comatose mud-caked man off the ground and drag him</p><p>home. Two women from inside the rancho follow them to the doorway,</p><p>smiling. Aside from a few furtive looks, they ignore us almost</p><p>entirely.</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t like this the year before, when Calzada first came here.</p><p>There is no En glish-language record of what happened to Chepo&#x2019;s</p><p>Kuna community in 2005, save the one you are reading now. The</p><p>mosquitoes that hatched from Chepo&#x2019;s stagnant puddles, the edges</p><p>of the lake below, in the open-water cisterns, had gone on a rampage.</p><p>Contaminated with the most malevolent malaria parasites known to</p><p>humankind in their spittle, they alit on the exposed and unclad Kuna</p><p>around them. By the time Calzada and his team arrived, nearly half</p><p>of the settlement was fevered, terrified, immobilized in their hammocks.</p><p>After days of triage, Calzada brought samples of the Kuna&#x2019;s infected</p><p>blood back to his lab at the Gorgas Institute to analyze.

For eight years and two months after World War I, Dempsey, with his fierce good looks and matchless dedication to the kill, was heavyweight champion of the world. A Flame of Pure Fire is the extraordinary story of a man and a country growing to maturity in a blaze of strength and exuberance that nearly burned them to ash. Hobo, roughneck, fighter, lover, millionaire, movie star, and, finally, a gentleman of rare generosity and sincerity, Dempsey embodied an America grappling with the confusing demands of preeminence. Dempsey lived a life that touched every part of the American experience in the first half of the twentieth century. Roger Kahn, one of our preeminent writers about the human side of sport, has found in Dempsey a subject that matches his own manifold talents. A friend of Dempsey's and an insightful observer of the ways in which sport can measure a society's evolution, Kahn reaches a new and exciting stage in his acclaimed career with this book. In the story of a man John Lardner called "a flame of pure fire, at last a hero," Roger Kahn finds the heart of America.<br></p><p>Jack Dempsey (1895-1983) launched the age of big-money, high-visibility boxing with his 1919 defeat of heavyweight champion Jess Willard. Then when Gene Tunney beat Dempsey in 1927, assisted by a referee's controversial "long count," it foreshadowed the end of an era. With his good looks, free-and-easy ways, and roughneck background--including an ex-wife who was a prostitute before and after their marriage--Dempsey was the perfect hero for the brawling, cynical 1920s. Even his sensational trial in 1920 on charges of draft evasion and "white slavery" (he was acquitted) suited the decade's appetite for lurid tabloid stories. Roger Kahn, who met the fighter in the mid-1950s, takes an idiosyncratic approach to biography. He begins with a 1960 encounter in Dempsey's restaurant, moves back to the fighter's hard-knocks apprenticeship, covers Dempsey's childhood after an account of the 1920 trial, and intersperses snapshots of the American scene with recollections and reflections from the champ throughout. This technique pays off. Readers get a vivid sense of the period and of Dempsey as its hard-living but honorable exemplar, and they come to share Kahn's affection and respect for the thoughtful, generous man he became in later years. Squeamish readers, be warned: along with the cultural history, there's lots of boxing action, graphically described. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>Widely acclaimed as the greatest baseball writer of his generation, Roger Kahn is most famous for his modern classic, The Boys of Summer, which James Michener called the finest American book on sports. Kahn is the author of 16 books, most recently The Head Game, Baseball Seen from the Pitchers&#39; Mound. His magazine articles won five Dutton Best Magazine Story Awards and his book The Era: When the Yankees Dodgers and Giants Ruled the World was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize. Born in Brooklyn, he now lives in Stone Ridge, N.Y. with his wife, the psychotherapist Katharine Colt Johnson.</p><h2>The Child Thief: A Novel</h2><p><p>The acclaimed artist Brom brilliantly displays his multiple extraordinary talents in <em>The Child Thief</em>&#x2014;a spellbinding re-imagining of the beloved Peter Pan story that carries readers through the perilous mist separating our world from the realm of Faerie. As Gregory Maguire did with his <em>New York Times </em>bestselling <em>Wicked</em> novels, Brom takes a classic children&#x2019;s tale and turns it inside-out, painting a Neverland that, like Maguire&#x2019;s Oz, is darker, richer, more complex than innocent world J.M. Barrie originally conceived. An&nbsp;ingeniously executed&nbsp;literary feat, illustrated with Brom&#x2019;s sumptuous artwork, <em>The Child Thief </em>is contemporary fantasy at its finest&#x2014;casting Peter Pan, the Lost Boys, even Captain Hook and his crew in a breathtaking new light.</p></p><p><blockquote><p>Peter is quick, daring, and full of mischief&#x2014;and like all boys, he loves to play, though his games often end in blood. His eyes are sparkling gold, and when he graces you with his smile you are his friend for life, but his promised land is <em>not</em> Neverland.</p></blockquote><p>Fourteen-year-old Nick would have been murdered by the drug dealers preying on his family had Peter not saved him. Now the irresistibly charismatic wild boy wants Nick to follow him to a secret place of great adventure, where magic is alive and you never grow old. Even though he is wary of Peter's crazy talk of faeries and monsters, Nick agrees. After all, New York City is no longer safe for him, and what more could he possibly lose?</p><p>There is <em>always</em> more to lose.</p><p>Accompanying Peter to a gray and ravished island that was once a lush, enchanted paradise, Nick finds himself unwittingly recruited for a war that has raged for centuries&#x2014;one where he must learn to fight or die among the "Devils," Peter's savage tribe of lost and stolen children.</p><p>There, Peter's dark past is revealed: left to wolves as an infant, despised and hunted, Peter moves restlessly between the worlds of faerie and man. The Child Thief is a leader of bloodthirsty children, a brave friend, and a creature driven to do whatever he must to stop the "Flesh-eaters" and save the last, wild magic in this dying land.</p><p>Over the past few decades, Brom has lent his distinctive vision to all facets of the creative industries, from novels and games to comics and film. He is the author of <em>The Child Thief</em> and the award-winning illustrated horror novels <em>The Plucker</em> and <em>The Devil's Rose</em>. Brom is currently kept in a dank cellar somewhere just outside of Seattle.</p></p><h2>Work Of God: Benedictine Prayer</h2><p><p>From its beginnings, Benedictinism has touched the lives of many people beyond those who dwell in monasteries. For those looking for an everyday grounding in Benedictine spirituality and who wish to pray according to theBenedictine style of Liturgy of the Hours, <i>Work of God</i> is an ideal resource.</p> <p>While written primarily for Benedictine oblates, this simple yet elegant prayer book also gives the unfamiliar user a starting place from which to progress into a more intense practice. Largely a two-week arrangement of morning and evening prayer, it also contains essays that provide a broad introduction to monastic spirituality and its relevance for non-monastics.</p> <p><i>Work of God</i> relies substantially on the ICEL psalms. The psalms for each day include at least one of those which Benedict recommended for the liturgical hour. The closing prayer for each liturgy is linked through words and images to some concept or quotation in the Rule, thus providing more of connection to Benedictine spirituality. Each day's liturgy includes a short reading and the New Testament canticle, so there's no need to turn from one section to another.</p> <p><i>Work of God</i> is not an official manual, but rather a convenient alternative to the multiple liturgy books used in some communities, the <i>Roman Breviary</i>, or more general or abbreviated office books. Beautifully bound with gilt-edged pages and one ribbon marker, it is a handsome addition to any bookshelf.</p> <p>Those who live in the spirit of St. Benedict are always alert to God. The opening word of the Rule, listen," is its essence. One listens first of all to the words of Scripture which teach God's way. <i>Work of God</i> helps the pray-er allow the Word to speak within the self in an environment of silence and solitude.</p> <p>Essays by Sutera are "The Life and the Spirit of St. Benedict," "Benedictinism and the World Around It: The Oblate Movement," and "Praying the Liturgy of the Hours." Irene Nowell, OSB, contributes the essay "Praying the Psalms." Other chapters are "Week I - Evening and Morning Praise," "The Practice of <i>Lectio</i>," "Thoughts from the Rule of St. Benedict," "Some Benedictine Prayers," "The Medal and the Cross of St. Benedict," "Week II - Evening and Morning Praise," "Major Feasts of the Church Year," "Common for Feasts of Christ," "Common for Feasts of Mary," "Common of Apostles and Martyrs," "Common of Holy Men and Women," and "Compline(Night Prayer)."</p>"</p><p></p><h2>Evangelism and the Sovereignty of God</h2><p>If God is in control of everything, can Christians sit back and not bother to evangelize? Or does active evangelism imply that God is not really sovereign at all? J.I. Packer shows in this classic study how both of these attitudes are false. In a careful review of the biblical evidence, he shows how a right understanding of God&#39;s sovereignty is not so much a barrier to evangelism as an incentive and powerful support for it.</p><p>The mystery and seeming paradox between evangelism and God's sovereignty has been causing disagreements and confusion among Christians since the beginning of the 20th century. In <i>Evangelism &amp; the Sovereignty of God</i>, J.I. Packer reveals that a faulty understanding of the Bible leads to the assessment that these doctrines are foes rather than friends. By debunking the erroneous view that "robust faith in the absolute sovereignty of God is bound to undermine any adequate sense of human responsibility" toward evangelism, the author adeptly moves through the obstacle course of tricky theology with ease and grace, allowing the reader a more complete understanding of the mystery of salvation. Packer manages to tackle an overwhelming piece of doctrinal truth and contain it within the subject of evangelism by concisely determining what evangelism is and what it is not. "It is our widespread and persistent habit of defining evangelism in terms, not of a message delivered, but of an effect produced in our hearers." This error is corrected when one is renewed in his or her knowledge of the sovereignty of God. Of course, fault is found on the other side as well, with those who so heavily rely on God's sovereignty to save the lost that they are lazy in obeying God's command to share the Gospel. Packer insists that love for God, at the very least, should draw one out of this stagnation and that the coupling of these seemingly diabolical doctrines will make one bold in speech, patient in God's timing, and prayerful for the salvation of others. <i>--Jill Heatherly</i>J. I. Packer is Board of Governors Professor of Theology at Regent College in Vancouver, British Columbia. He also serves as contributing editor to Christianity Today. Packer's writings include books such as Knowing God (IVP Books), A Quest for Godliness (Crossway), Growing in Christ (Crossway) and Rediscovering Holiness (Servant), and numerous articles published in journals such as Churchman, SouthWestern Journal, Christianity Today, Reformation &amp; Revival Journal and Touchstone.</p><h2>The Philosopher Stone</h2><p>Third Printing, 1977.

Tarcher, proves that he possesses significant skills in the area of fiction as well. Wilson weaves a great deal of speculation into the meaning of human existence and the future of the species into the plot; so much so that the book at times seems as much a work of philosophy as of fiction. The story centers on the experiences of Howard Lester, an enterprising young intellectual whose work with fellow researcher Henry Littleway leads to the discovery that implanting a minute bit of a metallic alloy into the prefrontal cortex of the brain can introduce a higher state of conciousness. (As in the case with Carlos Castaneda in his thematically-similar Don Juan chronicles, the researchers later discover that the artificial catalyst is not necessary, but rather a convenient means to overcome years of conditioning). Lester and Littleway perform the operation upon themselves and proceed to refine their new skills until they are able to employ a sort of "time visioif 'that allows them to tap into racial memories. With this knowledge comes the realization that there are shadowy periods in our species' past that have been kept hidden from us by more powerful beings. Lester relates his moment of insight: "I knew with certainty that there is something in the world's prehistory that cannot be found in any of the books on the past. And it was obscurely connected with [a] sense of evil...." In the course of discovering how the Eardi-and mankind-truly evolved, this intriguing tale touches upon everything from Mayan civilization to Abraham Maslow to H.P. Lovecraft's elder Gods. -- <i>From Independent Publisher</i>Purveyor of the occult, Wilson almost yearly produces fiction and nonfiction works that achieve popular if not critical success. This novel was first published here in 1971; it is being reissued, with a foreward by Joyce Carol Oates, as part of a series that makes available out-of-print classics in spirituality.

He built a career on the lie that he was born of a gypsy woman and cut his teeth in the wilds of the Siberian taiga. The truth was even more remarkable than that. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Here at last, is the man behind the legend--the half-Swiss, half-Tatar boy who grew up in China and Paris, smoked opium with Jean Cocteau, caroused with gypsies, worked as a trapeze artist, emigrated to America, married a starlet, and embarked on one of the most dynamic double careers Broadway and Hollywood would ever know.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yul Brynner electrified audiences with his portrayal of the tragic and despotic King ofSiam, a role he performed more than 4,000 times over a period of thirty years.It was a role that eventually became indistinguishable from the man, for YulBrynner was as much in love with power--and as much a victim of its illusions--as the king he played so brilliantly on stage. He was also every bit as mesmerizing and just as flawed.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yul's fame and riches transformed him. The year 1957 marked his Academy Award triumph as best actor in <i>The King and I</i>. It also marked the start of a torrential megalomania. Yul began to go through friends, wives, lovers, deals and associates with the rapacity of a Mongol chieftain.<br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yul</i> is the moving tale of a man who became king, and a king who became slave to his own extravagance. But it is also a spellbinding book about a star-studded era. The cast includes such greats as Cecil B. DeMille, Frank Sinatra, Muhammad Ali, Marlon Brando, RichardBurton, and Elizabeth Taylor. And then there are Yul's women: Virginia Gilmore, Marilyn Monroe, Judy Garland, Ingrid Bergman, Marlene Dietrich, and JoanCrawford, among many others.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Rock Brynner was the most attentive witness to Yul's astonishing life. In this deeply personal and loving memoir of a man who could be anything but loveable, Rock finally comes to terms with the tyrannical star, Rabelaisian womanizer, extravagant egoist, and self-inventor that was his father.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; A powerful and haunting book, <i>Yul</i> sets straight the record in Yul Brynner, and pays a tribute of truth to a magical actor, a difficult father, and an extraordinary man.</p><p><b>"Mr. Brynner is,quite simply, The King.

Aunt Delia&#x2019;s Manners Quiz for Kids and Their Grown-ups</i> is back, and do we and our kids all need it. In a series of light-hearted multiple choice quizzes, alternate scenarios, and true-or-false questions, Delia Ephron and Edward Koren, the author and illustrator team who brought us the best-selling <i>How to Eat Like a Child</i>, depict a range of possibilities that reflect life as it is as well as life as it ought to be. Covering table manners, car manners, playground manners, school manners, and more, this is a book that is sure to delight (and horrify) adults and children of all ages.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Aunt Delia knows what makes the difference between a pleasant and an excruciating visit to a friend&#x2019;s house in the company of a young child. She knows the proper order in which the following actions take place: (a) Throw up; (b) Get out of the car; (c) Ask Uncle Jerry to pull over. In short, she is practical and basic: she does not get into fish forks, but she knows what to do with bubble gum. She also deals with such things as kindness, sharing, consideration, generosity, and diplomacy. Delia Ephron&#x2019;s painfully on-target text is complemented by Edward Koren&#x2019;s hilarious drawings, which&#x2013;as ever&#x2013;present us not as we might wish to appear, but as we really are.</p><p><b>Delia Ephron</b> is a bestselling author and screenwriter.

Moradi&#x2019;s staff had urged him to wait, to not rush up there the same day, that afternoon. &#x201c;They won&#x2019;t know anything,&#x201d; Colonel Nadali had warned. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll bury you in raw data and argue with each other.&#x201d;<br>The general had learned to listen to Farzad Nadali, his chief of staff. The colonel&#x2019;s patience and good humor complemented Moradi&#x2019;s own fiery temperament. Nadali had counseled Moradi to wait until the scientists had something to tell him.<br>So finally, two days later, they were flying north in an Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Mi-17. Instead of jump seats for troops, the Russian-made transport helicopter was fitted for VIP travel, with increased soundproofing, comfortable seating, and fold-down work surfaces. A few hundred meters below them, the landscape was empty and broken, painted in shades of brown and gray, with stony hills rising from the left. It was still winter, and the morning cold did nothing to soften the desert landscape.<br>Moradi had made the trip often, and hardly noticed the harsh beauty of the ground below. Instead, he studied a briefing prepared by the scientists and e-mailed to his headquarters that morning. The general was sure they&#x2019;d been up all night working on it, but he was not sympathetic. A few more sleepless nights might have prevented this disaster.<br>Captain Hejazi&#x2019;s voice interrupted his review. &#x201c;Sir, Natanz is in sight.&#x201d; Moradi understood that his aide was referring to the uranium enrichment facility. They&#x2019;d spotted the town of Natanz proper five minutes ago. The facility was thirty kilometers farther to the north, surrounded by desert and rocky hills, but not isolated. Its front gate was just south of the Isfahan-Kashan road, a six-lane highway that actually passed through the outer ring of air defenses. A moment later the aide added, &#x201c;Major Sadi is monitoring our approach.&#x201d;<br>Moradi nodded, acknowledging the report. Sadi was in charge of the facility&#x2019;s air defenses, and simply because they were a scheduled flight didn&#x2019;t mean they couldn&#x2019;t be shot out of the sky.<br>The enrichment site itself was a rough square, a kilometer and a half on each side. A perimeter fence enclosed the pilot enrichment plant, the gigantic buried centrifuge halls, and the support buildings for those two vital facilities.<br>A few hundred meters out, a road paralleled the perimeter, connecting dozens of antiaircraft gun emplacements and watchtowers. Each gun position, a pair of manually aimed 23mm or 35mm autocannons, was ringed with sandbags and sited on an earthen mound to give it a better field of fire.<br>Farther out, a second ring bristled with even more guns: larger four-gun batteries of 100mm weapons, radar-directed 35mm batteries, scores of the manually aimed guns, and half a dozen batteries of surface-to-air missiles. Three early warning radars covered Natanz and the surrounding area. It was possible that Natanz was the most heavily defended place in Iran, except, of course, for Tehran itself.<br>And a lot of that was Moradi&#x2019;s doing. Since he&#x2019;d been placed in charge of the nuclear weapons program five years ago, he&#x2019;d tripled the number of SAM batteries and ordered a second ring of antiaircraft guns placed around Natanz. He&#x2019;d also handpicked Sadi for his post. The major was inexperienced, but competent, hardworking&#x2014;and loyal.<br>Moradi felt the helicopter descend, and he saved his notes and closed the laptop. As Hejazi packed up the general&#x2019;s computer, the helicopter hovered and then set down smoothly. The crew chief moved aft to open the side door, and Moradi remembered to remove his uniform cap before the rotor wash snatched it away.<br>The blades slowed, and figures outside ran toward the open door. A few were ground crew, but most were officers, with a few civilians scattered through the group. Moradi recognized the Natanz facility&#x2019;s commander, Colonel Zamanian, with his staff, including Sadi, and Nadali, who&#x2019;d arrived yesterday to manage the recovery and the investigation. Colonel Nadali was a great organizer, and he&#x2019;d been right to go ahead and manage things. Moradi knew he&#x2019;d probably have fired the lot on the spot.<br>The officers immediately fell into two ranks, and the civilians wandered about for a few moments, deciding where to stand. There was more than a little tension between the scientists, engineers, and the military. The civilians seemed reluctant to fall in line, but finally formed a knot at one end, not quite in line, but not sticking out either.<br>Nadali, who&#x2019;d placed himself at the near end of the front rank, saw Moradi appear in the open door and called &#x201c;Attention!&#x201d; The officers saluted as one, and even the civilians managed to stand a little straighter.<br>Brigadier General Adel Moradi of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, the <i>Pasdaran</i>, stepped from the helicopter. The Revolutionary government&#x2019;s propaganda machine had dubbed him &#x201c;The Lion of Karbala,&#x201d; for his bravery in the war with Iraq, but he knew his real nickname, the one his staff thought he didn&#x2019;t know about: &#x201c;The Rhino.&#x201d;<br>Smoothly slipping on his uniform cap, Moradi returned the salute. His hat was a dark olive green ball cap, matching his fatigues and emblazoned with the emblem of the Pasdaran in gold thread. The symbol was repeated on his breast pocket.<br>In his late fifties, Moradi was trim, almost athletic. His aide, Hejazi, was taller, but Moradi was still six foot one. Solidly built, his physical presence had always been an asset, both on the battlefield and in politics. Trimmed close, his beard was only lightly threaded with gray. It outlined a broad, weathered face that seemed to settle naturally into an impatient scowl.<br>Nadali didn&#x2019;t wait for Moradi to speak. Shouting over the helicopter&#x2019;s slowing turbines, the colonel reported, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re ready for you, sir.&#x201d; He pointed to a line of jeeps, and Moradi got into the lead vehicle without saying a word.<br>As Colonel Nadali climbed in the backseat, Moradi asked him, &#x201c;Is there anything worth seeing at the pilot plant?&#x201d;<br>Nadali shook his head sharply. &#x201c;No, sir, and as a matter of fact, they&#x2019;re encouraging us to keep clear of the area while they make another sweep for radiation and toxicity.&#x201d; He saw Moradi&#x2019;s expression and continued. &#x201c;When they spot-checked the first survey results, there were several errors&#x2014;all underreporting.&#x201d;<br>Moradi&#x2019;s scowl deepened. &#x201c;When will they be done?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;They couldn&#x2019;t start until it was daylight this morning. It will be late this afternoon.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Wonderful,&#x201d; Moradi rumbled. &#x201c;I wonder how many other mistakes they&#x2019;ve made.&#x201d; His tone made it clear that he was sure there were more. The other jeeps were pulling away, and Nadali ordered their driver to head for the administration building.<br>Nadali took the general to a conference room. Pasdaran sentries, armed with automatic weapons, flanked the door, and Nadali led the staff inside. When one of the civilians tried to go in the room, Nadali waved him back. &#x201c;The scientists will brief the general in half an hour. We just have some housekeeping and organizational issues to go over.&#x201d; The civilian nodded nervously and hurried away.<br>As soon as the general was seated, a middle-aged major looked over at Nadali, who nodded. &#x201c;The room has been swept, and is clear,&#x201d; the officer reported. &#x201c;The spaces on all sides of us, and above and below, are occupied by my people.&#x201d; Major Hassan Rahim was Moradi&#x2019;s intelligence and counterintelligence officer. He also belonged to VEVAK, the Ministry of Intelligence, but although everyone knew it, nobody ever mentioned it.<br>&#x201c;It was a careful sweep, Rahim? There are some clever people here,&#x201d; Nadali observed.<br>&#x201c;Not from what I&#x2019;ve seen,&#x201d; Moradi countered. &#x201c;What have you found, Hassan?&#x201d;<br>Rahim was a small officer&#x2014;short, and older than would be expected for a major. There were rumors that his real rank was much higher, but changed to match the assignment. His glasses gave him a professorial look, but his gaze was hard, and his tone cold. &#x201c;The centrifuges failed on their own, sir. I can find no sign of sabotage, either from foreign agents or someone inside.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s hard to prove the absence of something,&#x201d; Moradi offered.<br>Rahim pulled out a notepad and flipped through the pages. &#x201c;This is already one of the most secure installations in Iran. My people have enhanced those measures. We&#x2019;ve been able to correlate the movements of everyone on base that day with the entrance and exit logs for each building. Dr. Sabet has helped us with scenarios for sabotage, and who would have the knowledge to perform it. Everyone on the list is being watched. Most have been questioned.&#x201d;<br>Moradi nodded as he took in the information. He&#x2019;d expected this result. If Rahim had found anything amiss, the perpetrators would have been arrested instantly. VEVAK might have different masters than the Shah&#x2019;s SAVAK, but they used the same methods.<br>&#x201c;Could it have been that damned computer worm again?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Unlikely, sir. I had every computer on the installation checked, as well as all personal computers in the dormitories. Every CD and flash drive was also examined. There was no sign of the Stuxnet worm. As you recall, we found this worm on dozens of computers when the cyber attack was first discovered three years ago,&#x201d; remarked Rahim.<br>Stuxnet was a devilishly effective piece of malware that sought out and attacked the motor controllers on the centrifuges, causing them to under...</p><h2>Celestial Gallery</h2><p>Opening the oversized pages of Celestial Gallery is akin to entering a grand museum.

And what makes lions so proud? Collective nouns are one of the most charming oddities of the English language, often with seemingly bizarre connections to the groups they identify. But have you ever stopped to wonder where these peculiar terms actually came from? Most of those found in this book have their origins in the Medieval Books of Courtesy, among the earliest works to be published in this country. Despite originating as a form of social etiquette reserved for the gentry, many of these collective nouns have survived to become a curious feature of today&#39;s everyday language. This absorbing book tells the stories of these evocative phrases, many of which have stood the test of time and are still in use today. Entertaining, informative and fascinating, An Unkindness of Ravens is perfect for any history or language buff.</p><p><b>Chloe Rhodes</b> is a regular contributor to various magazines and journals.

While many poets and translators have attempted to capture the full glory of The Divine Comedy in English, many have fallen short. Victorian verse translations established an unfortunate tradition of reproducing the sprightly rhyming measures of Dante but at the same time betraying the strain on the translator&#39;s powers of invention. For Dante, the dramatic human stories of Hell were exciting, but the spiritual studies of Purgatory and the sublime panoramas of Heaven were no less so. In this incantatory new translation, James - defying the convention by writing in quatrains - tackles these problems head-on and creates a striking and hugely accessible translation that gives us The Divine Comedy as a whole, unified, and dramatic work.</p><p>Dante Alighieri's poetic masterpiece, The Divine Comedy, is a moving human drama, an unforgettable visionary journey through the infinite torment of Hell, up the arduous slopes of Purgatory, and on to the glorious realm of Paradise-the sphere of universal harmony and eternal salvation.<p> One of the greatest works in literature, Dantes story-poem is an allegory that represents mankind as it exposes itself, by its merits or demerits, to the rewards or the punishments of justice. A single listening will reveal Dantes visual imagination and uncanny power to make the spiritual visible.</p>This story begins in a shadowed forest on Good Friday in the year of our Lord 1300. It proceeds on a journey that, in its intense re-creation of the depths and the heights of human experience, has become the key with which Western civilization has sought to unlock the mystery of its own identity.</p><h2>The Gilmore Girls: Other Side of Summer</h2><p><p>It's true. The Chilton gods seem to get great amusement out of putting Paris and me in the same setting, be it academically or socially.

So she's working on being a "Chilton mom," and I'm trying to be a "Puff."

Her fanciful story rings true to anyone who has listened to the kinds of winding stories kindergartners create: Little Fox&#x2019;s made-up adventure takes her into the forest, across a river, into the mountains, over the ocean, and back, and she contends with monkeys, elephants, one-eyed cats, and more. Throughout, Little Fox&#x2019;s mother prompts her with questions; this is a helpful model for adults wishing to encourage young storytelling. As with Max&#x2019;s imaginary trip in Where the Wild Things Are (1963), when Little Fox&#x2019;s is over, a hot meal is waiting. Charming watercolor paintings show close-ups of the action, with Little Fox herself often in the background; the focus here is on the story&#x2019;s elements: crocodiles, monkeys, big waves, and the like. First published in 1976 with illustrations by John Wallner, this story continues to suit beginning adventurers.

While this book is not essentially a book of trivia, some of the items might be considered trivial. Unless an item is described as questionable, it is the result of cross-documentation that indicates it really happened beyond a reasonable doubt.

However when he preached his first sermon, before his family and colleagues of his father, Carroll felt impelled to express disapproval of the war. This was taken as an act of filial disloyalty causing an enormous breach between father and son. Each was a man of principle, each convinced that he was right and the other wrong. Carroll made the breach complete when he left the priesthood to marry. This is his poignant account of a divide that reflected wider American society.James Carroll was raised in Washington, D.C., and ordained to the Catholic priesthood in 1969. He served as a chaplain at Boston University from 1969 to 1974, then left the priesthood to become a writer.

Tour.</p><p>Analyzing the legend and lore of golf's most celebrated tournament has become something of a cottage industry of late, but Owen, who displayed his personal golfing affections, frustrations, and obsessions so marvelously in <i>My Usual Game</i>, now goes where his competition hasn't gained access: to the source--via access to Augusta National's archives, records, and membership. The result is a sympathetic, yet still critical and complex portrait of the club and its founder, Clifford Roberts, to whom golf history has not been particularly kind. Indeed, for better--and for worse--Roberts and Augusta remain linked throughout what is essentially a volume that weaves biography with social history played against a sporting canvas. Naturally, finance, ego, Bobby Jones, television, and President Eisenhower figure into the tale, but Eisenhower's not the only leader of the free world to use the club's exclusivity to his benefit; Owen uncovers the delicious bit that Ronald Reagan and George Schultz helped finalize the invasion of Grenada there.<p> Of course, there is also some great golf. Augusta National would be just another golf club with a fancy pedigree and history of exclusion were it not for the remarkable tournament that it hosts every year. Owen, a graceful writer, tees up plenty of detail and anecdote in a hole-by-hole tour of the track, lined with perspective. Owen explains, </p><blockquote>If the Masters seems older than it is, that's largely because the tournament, alone among the majors, is conducted year after year on the same course. Every important shot is played against a backdrop that consists of every other important shot, all the way back to 1934. Every key drive, approach, chip, and putt is footnoted and cross-referenced across decades of championship play.

But they don't always stay dead. </p><p>Believe me, I know. </p><p>There&#x2019;s a race of vampires on this earth who are literally the walking dead. They&#x2019;re called Strigoi, and if you&#x2019;re not already having nightmares about them, you should be. They&#x2019;re strong, they&#x2019;re fast, and they kill without mercy or hesitation. They&#x2019;re immortal, too&#x2014;which kind of makes them a bitch to destroy. There are only three ways to do it: a silver stake through the heart, decapitation, and setting them on fire. None of those is easy to pull off, but it&#x2019;s better than having no options at all. </p><p>There are also good vampires walking the world. They&#x2019;re called Moroi. They&#x2019;re alive, and they possess the incredibly cool power to wield magic in each of the four elements&#x2014; earth, air, water, and fire. (Well, most Moroi can do this&#x2014;but I&#x2019;ll explain more about the exceptions later). They don&#x2019;t really use the magic for much anymore, which is kind of sad. It&#x2019;d be a great weapon, but the Moroi strongly believe magic should only be used peacefully. It&#x2019;s one of the biggest rules in their society. Moroi are also usually tall and slim, and they can&#x2019;t handle a lot of sunlight. But they do have superhuman senses that make up for it: sight, smell, and hearing. </p><p>Both kinds of vampires need blood. That&#x2019;s what makes them vampires, I guess. Moroi don&#x2019;t kill to take it, however. Instead, they keep humans around who willingly donate small amounts. They volunteer because vampire bites contain endorphins that feel really, really good and can become addictive. I know this from personal experience. These humans are called feeders and are essentially vampire-bite junkies. </p><p>Still, keeping feeders around is better than the way the Strigoi do things, because, as you might expect, they kill for their blood. I think they like it. If a Moroi kills a victim while drinking, he or she will turn into a Strigoi. Some Moroi do this by choice, giving up their magic and their morals for immortality. Strigoi can also be created by force. If a Strigoi drinks blood from a victim and then makes that person drink Strigoi blood in return, well . . . you get a new Strigoi. This can happen to anyone: Moroi, human, or . . . dhampir. </p><p>Dhampir. </p><p>That&#x2019;s what I am. Dhampirs are half-human, half-Moroi. I like to think we got the best traits of both races. I&#x2019;m strong and sturdy, like humans are. I can also go out in the sun as much as I want. But, like the Moroi, I have really good senses and fast reflexes. The result is that dhampirs make the ultimate bodyguards&#x2014;which is what most of us are. We&#x2019;re called guardians. </p><p>I&#x2019;ve spent my entire life training to protect Moroi from Strigoi. I have a whole set of special classes and practices I take at St. Vladimir&#x2019;s Academy, a private school for Moroi and dhampirs. I know how to use all sorts of weapons and can land some pretty mean kicks. I&#x2019;ve beaten up guys twice my size&#x2014;both in and out of class. And really, guys are pretty much the only ones I beat up, since there are very few girls in any of my classes. </p><p>Because while dhampirs inherit all sorts of great traits, there&#x2019;s one thing we didn&#x2019;t get. Dhampirs can&#x2019;t have children with other dhampirs. Don&#x2019;t ask me why. It&#x2019;s not like I&#x2019;m a geneticist or anything. Humans and Moroi getting together will always make more dhampirs; that&#x2019;s where we came from in the first place. But that doesn&#x2019;t happen so much anymore; Moroi tend to stay away from humans. Through another weird genetic fluke, however, Moroi and dhampirs mixing will create dhampir children. I know, I know: it&#x2019;s crazy. You&#x2019;d think you&#x2019;d get a baby that&#x2019;s three-quarters vampire, right? Nope. Half human, half Moroi. </p><p>Most of these dhampirs are born from Moroi men and dhampir women getting together. Moroi women stick to having Moroi babies. What this usually means is that Moroi men have flings with dhampir women and then take off. This leaves a lot of single dhampir mothers, and that&#x2019;s why not as many of them become guardians. They&#x2019;d rather focus on raising their children. </p><p>As a result, only the guys and a handful of girls are left to become guardians. But those who choose to protect Moroi are serious about their jobs. Dhampirs need Moroi to keep having kids. We have to protect them. Plus, it&#x2019;s just . . . well, it&#x2019;s the honorable thing to do. Strigoi are evil and unnatural. It isn&#x2019;t right for them to prey on the innocent. Dhampirs who train to be guardians have this drilled into them from the time they can walk. Strigoi are evil. Moroi must be protected. Guardians believe this. I believe this. </p><p>And there&#x2019;s one Moroi I want to protect more than anyone in the world: my best friend, Lissa. She&#x2019;s a Moroi princess. The Moroi have twelve royal families, and she&#x2019;s the only one left in hers&#x2014;the Dragomirs. But there&#x2019;s something else that makes Lissa special, aside from her being my best friend. </p><p>Remember when I said every Moroi wields one of the four elements? Well, it turns out Lissa wields one no one even knew existed until recently: spirit. For years, we thought she just wasn&#x2019;t going to develop her magical abilities. Then strange things started happening around her. For example, all vampires have an ability called compulsion that lets them force their will on others. Strigoi have it really strongly. It&#x2019;s weaker in Moroi, and it&#x2019;s also forbidden. Lissa, however, has it almost as much as a Strigoi. She can bat her eyelashes, and people will do what she wants. </p><p>But that&#x2019;s not even the coolest thing she can do. </p><p>I said earlier that dead things don&#x2019;t always stay dead. Well, I&#x2019;m one of them. Don&#x2019;t worry&#x2014;I&#x2019;m not like the Strigoi. But I did die once. (I don&#x2019;t recommend it.) It happened when the car I was riding in slid off the road. The accident killed me, Lissa&#x2019;s parents, and her brother. Yet, somewhere in the chaos&#x2014;without even realizing it&#x2014;Lissa used spirit to bring me back. We didn&#x2019;t know about this for a long time. In fact, we didn&#x2019;t even know spirit existed at all. </p><p>Unfortunately, it turned out that one person did know about spirit before we did. Victor Dashkov, a dying Moroi prince, found out about Lissa&#x2019;s powers and decided he wanted to lock her up and make her his own personal healer&#x2014;for the rest of her life. When I realized someone was stalking her, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I broke us out of school to run off and live among humans. It was fun&#x2014;but also kind of nerve-wracking&#x2014;to always be on the run. We got away with this for two years until the authorities at St. Vladimir&#x2019;s hunted us down and dragged us back a few months ago. </p><p>That was when Victor made his real move, kidnapping her and torturing her until she gave into his demands. In the process, he took some pretty extreme measures&#x2014;like zapping me and Dimitri, my mentor, with a lust spell. (I&#x2019;ll get to him later). Victor also exploited the way spirit was starting to make Lissa mentally unstable. But even that wasn&#x2019;t as bad as what he did to his own daughter Natalie. He went so far as to encourage her to turn into a Strigoi to help cover his escape. She ended up getting staked. Even when captured after the fact, Victor didn&#x2019;t seem to display too much guilt over what he&#x2019;d asked her to do. Makes me think I wasn&#x2019;t missing out on growing up without a father. </p><p>Still, I now have to protect Lissa from Strigoi and Moroi. Only a few officials know about what she can do, but I&#x2019;m sure there are other Victors out there who would want to use her. Fortunately, I have an extra weapon to help me guard her. Somewhere during my healing in the car accident, spirit forged a psychic bond between her and me. I can see and feel what she experiences. (It only works one way, though. She can&#x2019;t &#x201c;feel&#x201d; me.) The bond helps me keep an eye on her and know when she&#x2019;s in trouble, although sometimes, it&#x2019;s weird having another person inside your head. We&#x2019;re pretty sure there are lots of other things spirit can do, but we don&#x2019;t know what they are yet. </p><p>In the meantime, I&#x2019;m trying to be the best guardian I can be. Running away put me behind in my training, so I have to take extra classes to make up for lost time. There&#x2019;s nothing in the world I want more than to keep Lissa safe. Unfortunately, I&#x2019;ve got two things that complicate my training now and then. One is that I sometimes act before I think. I&#x2019;m getting better at avoiding this, but when something sets me off, I tend to punch first and then find out who I actually hit later. When it comes to those I care about being in danger . . . well, rules seem optional. </p><p>The other problem in my life is Dimitri. He&#x2019;s the one who killed Natalie, and he&#x2019;s a total badass. He&#x2019;s also pretty good-looking. Okay&#x2014;more than good-looking. He&#x2019;s hot&#x2014;like, the kind of hot that makes you stop walking on the street and get hit by traffic. But, like I said, he&#x2019;s my instructor. And he&#x2019;s twenty-four. Both of those are reasons why I shouldn&#x2019;t have fallen for him. But, honestly, the most important reason is that he and I will be Lissa&#x2019;s guardians when she graduates. If he and I are checking each other out, then that means we aren&#x2019;t looking out for her. </p><p>I haven&#x2019;t had much luck in getting over him, and I&#x2019;m pretty sure he still feels the same about me. Part of what makes it so difficult is that he and I got pretty hot and heavy when we got hit with the lust spell. Victor had wanted to distract us while he kidnapped Lissa, and it had worked. I&#x2019;d been ready to give up my virginity, and Dimitri had been ready to take it. At the last minute, we broke the spell, but those memories are always with me and make it kind of hard to focus on combat moves sometimes. </p><p>By the way, my name&#x2019;s Rose Hathaway. I&#x2019;m seventeen years old, training to protect and kill vampires, in love with a completely unsuitable guy, and have a best friend whose weird magic could drive her crazy. </p><p>Hey, no one said high school was easy.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><h2>The Chinese Medicine Bible: The Definitive Guide to Holistic Healing (Mind Body Spirit Bibles)</h2><p>From tai chi to acupressure, the ancient art of Chinese medicine remains as popular today as ever.

But she has, and here is the record of that change in the decade since the publication of her last nonfiction collection, The Language of the Night. And what a mind strong, supple, disciplined, playful, ranging over the whole field of its concerns, from modern literature to menopause, from utopian thought to rodeos, with an eloquence, wit, and precision that makes for exhilarating reading.</p><p>"Insightful, impassioned, sometimes lyrical, often funny . . . a trove of delights<i>."--Los Angeles Times Book Review</i>. "Eloquent, elegant . . . funny, sharp . . . provocative."--<i>Washington Post</i>This collection of lucid, witty, warm, and intelligent "talks, essays, occasional pieces and reviews" was written with the goal "to subvert as much as possible without hurting anybody's feelings" on matters about which she says "I think I ought to stand up and be counted, lest silence collude with injustice." Her subjects, which she categorizes (and even codes for the reader) as Feminism, Social Responsibility, Literature, and Travel, offer astute observations on a variety of timely topics. What do women recently graduated from college need to know? Where do ideas come from? What are the prospects for women in writing? "No matter how successful, beloved, influential her work was, when a woman author dies, nine times out of ten, she gets dropped from the lists, the courses, the anthologies, while the men get kept... If she had the nerve to have children, her chances of getting dropped are higher still... So if you want your writing to be taken seriously, don't marry and have kids, and above all, don't die. But if you have to die, commit suicide. They approve of that." This collection offers both nutritious food for thought and excellent examples of a variety of writing styles: well-researched essays, whimsical and imaginative anecdotes, reflective personal memory. It is spiced to perfection with Ursula LeGuin's great sense of humor through which she takes herself and her subject matter just seriously enough. <i>-- For great reviews of books for girls, check out Let's Hear It for the Girls: 375 Great Books for Readers 2-14</i>. -- <i>From 500 Great Books by Women; review by Jesse Larsen</i></p><h2>Trees for All Seasons: Broadleaved Evergreens for Temperate Climates</h2><p><p>It's simple: broadleaved evergreens are trees that don't lose their leaves. And despite their versatility and beauty, they are often underused. Why? Most people, including knowledgeable gardeners, equate evergreens with conifers&#x2014;and Christmas trees&#x2014; rather than broadleaved plants. And many of the most attractive broadleaved evergreens have only recently become commercially available. Sean Hogan&#x2014;one of America's most respected and well-known horticulturists&#x2014;aims to correct the problem with this groundbreaking title. Ten years of research has gone into the detailed descriptions and photographs of more than 300 choice trees. Hogan opens our eyes to a largely unexplored world of foliar beauty&#x2014;from China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan to Australia, Tasmania, and New Zealand; from Chile and Argentina to Mexico and the western United States. Among the profiled plants are the drought-tolerant, russetbarked manzanitas; the finely textured, glossy-leaved azaras; and the exquisitely fragrant michelias. Also included are little-known gems from such well-known genera as the hollies and oaks. Hogan has filled an obvious gap in horticultural literature. By bringing to light hundreds of exciting plants that have the potential to transform gardens, he also performs an outstanding service. </p></p><p>Sean Hogan is the co-founder of Cistus Design in Portland, Oregon. He was formerly a horticulturist at the University of California, Berkeley Botanic Garden, where he managed the New World Desert, Australia/New Zealand, Africa, and California-cultivar gardens. He is a frequent contributor to horticultural journals such as the <i>Rock Garden Quarterly</i> and <i>Pacific Horticulture</i>.&#x201c;The strength of this volume lies in the inclusion of many relatively unknown species of horticultural interest.

Thompson. Fearlessly, he hurls himself into each assignment, gouges out the truth, then returns with a fresh story no one else on earth could write. From Nixon to napalm, Las Vegas to Watergate, Carter to cocaine, hippies to himself, Thompson's razor-sharp insight and crystal clarity capture the crazy, hypocritical, degenerate, and redeeming aspects of the explosive and colorful '60s and '70s. Thompson is a rebel and an artist, and we are all richer for it.<br>"No other reporter reveals how much we have to fear and loathe, yet does it so hilariously."<br>-- Chicago Tribune</p><p>In addition to being a testament to the undeniably beatifying properties of American excess--literary, political, chemical, you name it--Hunter Thompson is the high priest of the ad hominem attack. Anyone unlucky enough to get in the way of his satirical sledgehammer will end up with soup for brains. Still, even Thompson needs a good villain to get properly lathered up; that's why he peaked simultaneously with America's 37th president, Richard Milhous Nixon. Tricky Dick was Thompson's dark-jowled, pale-calved Muse, and with his departure Thompson seemed to lose his place a bit. Swatting flies with a baseball bat. <p> You need look no further for this writer's best: this collection of pieces, first published in 1979, spans all of Thompson's primo era, including short pieces and selections from longer works. <i>The Great Shark Hunt</i> sports a few articles filed by a pre-Gonzo Hunter S. Thompson, which show flickers of passion but no real fire; the first experiments with the author's drug-fueled brand of journalism at the Kentucky Derby; and finally the gigs that made him an American institution, in Las Vegas and on the 1972 campaign trail.</p><p> Thompson's style is so unique that a reader is tempted to think that he leapt, fully formed, into Gonzohood. However, along with the crazy, careening prose itself, one of the auxiliary pleasures of <i>The Great Shark Hunt</i> is the map that it gives of Thompson's ascent (or descent, if you prefer) from the workaday hyperbole of sports writing to the hell-blast vigor of his later work. The drugs are, by and large, a distraction--lifestyle points that get in the way of the genuinely perceptive journalism that Thompson created. (But they are there, always, and in quantity.) If you're looking for insight into the underbelly of America, Hunter S. Thompson is your best and only guide, and <i>The Great Shark Hunt</i> is an excellent place to begin the grim safari. <i>--Michael Gerber</i></p><b>Hunter S.

As a boy growing up in the Dakota Territory, Fraser witnessed the virtual extinction of the buffalo and the effect their loss had on the Plains Indians. As an adult, he honored both in his sculptures and his design for the buffalo nickel. Morrison&#x2019;s striking illustrations capture the broad sweep of the landscape and demonstrate the intricate process by which coins are designed and minted.</p><p>Taylor Morrison pairs his artistic talent with extensive research to bring readers engaging nonfiction picturebooks. A graduate of the Rhode Island School of Design, he has illustrated several books for children. He was born in Kansas, raised in Illinois, and now makes his home in Oregon.Grades 3-5--This unique picture book recalls the life and work of James Earle Fraser and his creative design chosen for the buffalo nickel in 1912. Morrison follows the sculptor from his childhood friendships with Native Americans in the Dakota Territory and early exposure to various art mediums and styles through his formal study in Paris with Augustus Saint-Gaudens and his art experience in New York City. A resource for young numismatists, the book also describes the step-by-step development of a coin through the design and manufacturing headaches that accompanied the production of the buffalo or Indian head nickel. Morrison displays his talents in the brushstrokes of sweeping, cloud-filled traditional landscapes and faithful representations of Fraser's work. Illustrations of sculpture and adult figures in rich colors smoothly follow his historical narrative, despite occasional proportional irregularities in representations of children. However, the author brings to life the accomplishments of an often neglected, but important contributor to sculpture and American art in general. Morrison's concise summary details the design and production processes of coins while identifying Fraser's works.<br><i>Mary Elam, Forman Elementary School, Plano, TX</i><br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The House Tells the Story: Homes of the American Presidents</h2><p>An incredible collaboration featuring a stunning collection of Presidential homes painted by artist Adam Van Doren and introduced by David McCullough<p></p><p>Pre-eminent historian David McCullough and noted artist Adam Van Doren unite for an excursion to the celebrated homes of fifteen American presidents, past and present.

This is a coffee-table book after all, and an accomplished, handsome, and even quite useful example of the genre, particularly if you are contemplating a heritage vacation. --<i>Christian Science Monitor</i><br><br><p><i>The House Tells the Story: Homes of the American Presidents</i>, by Adam Van Doren, Foreword by David McCullough (David R. Godine): It s been a good run for the domestic lives of famous Americans. In 2013, Myron Magnet published The Founders at Home, an examination of the architecture and home life of the American founders. Now, a sort of companion emerges with the release of The House Tells the Story. In the book, Adam Van Doren, an artist and professor at Yale, visits the homes of fifteen former American presidents, sketching their origins and noting details in epistolary form. These letters, mailed to the historian David McCullough, who contributed the book s foreword, reveal the artist s thoughts on the subjects of his paintings. Personal, insightful, and handsome, the paintings complement the letters to create a unified sense of our presidents homes. <i>--BR</i> --<i>The New Criterion</i></p><br><p>The sweep of this book (and the informative back matter) is remarkable, and the illustrations are often breathtaking. Expect this volume to encourage many readers to visit presidential homes. --Ilene Cooper, <i>Booklist</i><br><br></p><p>The doors of 15 presidential homes are opened to readers of this book, an illustrated tour winding through history with stops at residences both stately and modest. Adam Van Doren s watercolor paintings of such homes as George Washington s <br>Mount Vernon estate and the Kennedys Hyannis Port compound are displayed in full-page panoramas and handwritten,<br>illustrated letters that Van Doren sent to Pulitzer Prize-winning historian David McCullough when he visited each home[...]This book does indeed tell a story, one that is architectural, political, and personal.--Eryn Carlson, <i>The Boston Globe</i></p><br><p><i>The House Tells the Story</i> if it does nothing else, proves that the art of letter writing is not, after all, dead. Every page of each letter contains one or more charming and evocative watercolor pictures of the houses, furniture, vistas, and historical incidents...[it] is an utter delight, as it opens windows into the history of this country by showing how some of this country's makers and shapers lived. --John Steele Gordon, <i>Wall Street Journal</i></p></p><h2>Pogo&#39;s Will Be That Was (Fireside Book)</h2><p>Positively Pogo&#34; are comic strips from around 1954 first published in newspapers. This part starts with the start of the television media with various characters doing things to break into commercials and shows. The strip then meanders into a plan by Churchy (the turtle) to make money by making money. We have a long appearance by a non-regular character (in the form of a pig) which just happens to look like a certain Soviet leader of the time (part of Kelly&#39;s political humor). The book then ends with the Olympics in Australia.</p><p></p><h2>The Information</h2><p>Martin Amis is at his savage best in this magnificent novel of literary envy.

The small problems that can deeply trouble a child like the loss of a library card are overcome in the context of an understanding and caring family; and the hopes of these girls as to careers, weddings, and adulthood in general are lovingly described.<br></p><p>There's something to be said for a book that makes you wish you'd been part of a poor immigrant family living in New York's upper east side on the eve of World War I. Sydney Taylor's time-honored classic does just that. Life is rich for the five mischievous girls in the family. They find adventure in visiting the library, going to market with Mama, even dusting the front room. Young readers who have never shared a bedroom with four siblings, with no television in sight, will vicariously experience the simple, old-fashioned pleasures of talk, make-believe, and pilfered penny candy. The family's Jewish faith strengthens their ties to each other, while providing still more excitement and opportunity for mischief. Readers unfamiliar with Judaism will learn with the girls during each beautifully depicted holiday. This lively family, subject of four more "all-of-a- kind" books, is full of unique characters, all deftly illustrated by Helen John. Taylor based the stories on her own childhood family, and the true-life quality of her writing gives this classic its page-turning appeal. <i>(Ages 9 to 12)</i>Meet the All-of-a-Kind Family -- Ella, Henny, Sarah, Charlotte, and Gertie -- who live with their parents in New York City at the turn of the century.<p> Together they share adventures that find them searching for hidden buttons while dusting Mama's front parlor and visiting with the peddlers in Papa's shop on rainy days.

National ad/promo. Tour.</p><p>This book is an overview of the career of the FBI man who nearly single-handedly created the system for personality profiling of violent offenders. If there's a big-time multiple murderer from about 1950 until now who hasn't been interviewed by Robert Ressler, he probably refused the honor. Indispensable reading for serial killer mavens, and better written than John Douglas and Mark Olshaker's <i>Mindhunter</i>, this book is packed with fascinating details from dozens of cases: The killer John Joubert, for example, started his life of cruelty as a kid one day when he was riding his bike with a sharpened pencil in his hand. He rode up next to a little girl who was walking, and stabbed her in the back with the pencil. Ouch!Robert K. Ressler (1937-2013) was an expert in the area of violent criminal offenders and a twenty-year veteran of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He innovated many of the programs which led to the formulation of the FBI&#39;s National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime.</p><h2>A Hunter of Peace: Mary T.S.

I see it through my eyelids, blazing out of history from that bloody day, hinting at fires indescribable. It is like something holy, as if it were the light of God&#x2019;s own heaven that burned the world and billions of lives with it. I carry that light always, seared into the back of my mind. I make no excuses, no denials, no apologies for what I have done. I know what I am.<br><br>The scholiasts might start at the beginning, with our remote ancestors clawing their way out of Old Earth&#x2019;s system in their leaking vessels, those peregrines making their voyages to new and living worlds. But no. To do so would take more volumes and ink than my hosts have left at my disposal, and even I, who has more time than any other, have not the time for that.&nbsp;<br><br>Should I chronicle the war, then? Start with the alien Cielcin howling out of space in ships like castles of ice? You can find the war stories, read the death counts. The statistics. No context can make you understand the cost. Cities razed, planets burned. Countless billions of our people ripped from their worlds to serve as meat and slaves for those Pale monsters. Families old as empires ended in light and fire. The tales are numberless, and they are not enough. The Empire has its official version, one that ends in my execution, with Hadrian Marlowe hanged for all the worlds to see.&nbsp;<br><br>I do not doubt that this tome will do aught but collect dust in the archive where I have left it, one manuscript amongst billions at Colchis. Forgotten. Perhaps that is best. The worlds have had enough of tyrants, enough of murderers and genocides.&nbsp;<br><br>But perhaps you will read on, tempted by the thought of reading the work of so great a monster as the one made in my image. You will not let me be forgotten because you want to know what it was like to stand aboard that impossible ship and rip the heart out of a star. You want to feel the heat of two civilizations burning and to meet the dragon, the devil that wears the name my father gave me.&nbsp;<br><br>So let us bypass history, sidestep the politics and the marching tramp of empires. Forget the beginnings of mankind in the fire and ash of Old Earth, and so too ignore the Cielcin rising in cold and from darkness. Those tales are recorded elsewhere in all the tongues of mankind and her subjects. Let us move to the only beginning I&#x2019;ve a right to: my own.&nbsp;<br><br>I was born the eldest son and heir to Alistair Marlowe, Archon of Meidua Prefecture, Butcher of Linon, and Lord of Devil&#x2019;s Rest. No place for a child, that palace of dark stone, but it was my home all the same, amid the logothetes and the armored peltasts who served my father. But Father never wanted a child. He wanted an heir, someone to inherit his slice of Empire and to carry on our family legacy. He named me Hadrian, an ancient name, meaningless save for the memories of those men who carried it before me. An Emperor&#x2019;s name, fit to rule and be followed.&nbsp;<br><br>Dangerous things, names. A kind of curse, defining us that we might live up to them, or giving us something to run away from. I have lived a long life, longer than the genetic therapies the great houses of the peerage can contrive, and I have had many names. During the war, I was Hadrian Halfmortal and Hadrian the Deathless. After the war, I was the Sun Eater. To the poor people of Borosevo, I was a myrmidon called Had. To the Jaddians, I was Al Neroblis. To the Cielcin, I was Oimn Belu and worse things besides. I have been many things: soldier and servant, captain and captive, sorcerer and scholar and little more than a slave.<br><br>But before I was any of these, I was a son.&nbsp;<br>* * *<br>My mother was late to my birth, and both my parents watched from a platform above the surgical theater while I was decanted from the vat. They say I screamed as the scholiasts birthed me and that I had all my teeth in my head. Thus nobility is always born: without encumbering the mother and under the watchful eye of the Imperial High College, ensuring that our genetic deviations had not turned to defects and curdle in our blood. Besides, childbearing of the traditional sort would have required my parents to share a bed, which neither was inclined to do. Like so many nobiles, my parents wed out of political necessity.<br><br>My mother, I later learned, preferred the company of women to that of my father and rarely spent time on the family estate, attending my father only during formal functions. My father, by contrast, preferred his work. Lord Alistair Marlowe was not the sort of man who gave attention to his vices. Indeed, my father was not the sort of man who <i>had</i> vices. He was possessed by his office and by the good name of our house.&nbsp;<br><br>By the time I was born, the Crusade had been raging for three hundred years since the first battle with the Cielcin at Cressgard, but it was far away across some twenty thousand light- years of Empire and open space, out where the Veil opened on the Norma Arm. While my father did his best to impress upon me the gravity of the situation, things at home were quiet, save for the levies the Imperial Legions pulled from the plebeians every decade. We were decades from the front even on the fastest ships, and despite the fact that the Cielcin were the greatest threat our species had faced since the death of Old Earth, things were not so dire as that.<br><br>As you might expect from parents such as mine, I was given into the hands of my father&#x2019;s servants almost at once. Father doubtless returned to his work within an hour of my birth, having wasted all the time he could afford that day on so troubling a distraction as his son. Mother returned to her mother&#x2019;s house to spend time with her siblings and lovers; as I said, mother was not involved in the family&#x2019;s bleak business.&nbsp;<br><br>That business was uranium. My father&#x2019;s lands sat atop some of the richest deposits in the sector, and our family had presided over its extraction for generations. The money my father pulled in through the Wong-Hopper Consortium and Free Traders Union made him the richest man on Delos, richer even than the vicereine, my grandmother.<br><br>I was four when Crispin was born, and at once my little brother began to prove himself the ideal heir, which is to say that he obeyed my father, if no one else. At two he was almost as large as I was at six, and by five Crispin had gained a head on me. I never made up that difference.<br>&nbsp;<br>I had all the education you might expect the son of a prefectural archon to have. My father&#x2019;s castellan, Sir Felix Martyn, taught me to fight with sword, shield- belt, and handgun. He taught me to fire a lance and trained my body away from indolence. From Helene, the castle&#x2019;s chamberlain, I learned decorum: the intricacies of the bow and the handshake and of formal address. I learned to dance, to ride a horse and a skiff, and to fly a shuttle. From Abiatha, the old chanter who tended the belfry and the altar in the Chantry sanctum, I learned not only prayer but skepticism and that even priests have doubts. From his masters, the priors of the Holy Terran Chantry, I learned to guard those doubts for the heresy they were. And of course there was my mother, who told me stories: tales of Simeon the Red, Cid Arthur, and Kasia Soulier. Tales of Kharn Sagara. You laugh, but there is a magic in stories that cannot be ignored.<br><br>And yet it was Tor Gibson who made me the man I am, he who taught me my first lesson. &#x201c;Knowledge is the mother of fools,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Remember, the greatest part of wisdom in recognizing your own ignorance.&#x201d; He always said such things. He taught me rhetoric, arithmetic, and history.He schooled me in biology, mechanics, astrophysics, and philosophy. It was he who taught me languages and a love for words; by ten I spoke Mandar well as any child of the interspace corporations and could read the fire poetry of Jadd like a true acolyte of their faith. Most important of all, it was he who taught me about the Cielcin, the murderous, marauding alien scourge chewing at the edges of civilization. It was he who taught me a fascination with the xenobites and their cultures.&nbsp;<br><br>I can only hope the history books will not damn him for it.<br>* * *<br>&#x201c;You look comfortable,&#x201d; said Tor Gibson, voice like a dry wind in the still air of the training hall.<br><br>Moving slowly, I pulled out of the complex stretch I&#x2019;d folded myself into and flowed through the next position, twisting my spine. &#x201c;Sir Felix and Crispin will be here soon. I want to be ready.&#x201d; Through the small, arched windows set high in the stone walls, I could just make out the calls of seabirds, their noise muffled by the house shields.&nbsp;<br><br>The old scholiast, face impassive as a stone, moved round into my line of sight, slippered feet scuffing on the mosaic tile work. Stooped though he was by time, the old tutor still stood taller than me, his square face smiling now beneath his mane of white hair, side whiskers making him look like nothing so much as the lions the vicereine kept in her menagerie. &#x201c;Looking to put the little master flat on his ass, are you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Which ass?&#x201d; I grinned, stooping to touch my toes, voice creaking a little with the strain. &#x201c;The one between his ears?&#x201d;<br><br>Gibson&#x2019;s thin smile vanished. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d do well not to speak of your brother thus.&#x201d;<br><br>I shrugged, adjusting one of the thin straps that kept my dueling jerkin flat over my shirt. Leaving Gibson where he stood, I crossed barefoot to the rack where the training weapons waited on display by the fencing round, a slightly elevated wooden disc about twenty feet across, marked for dueling practice. &#x201c;Did we have a lesson this morning, Gibson? I thought it wasn&#x2019;t until this afternoon.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; He tipped his head, shuffling a little closer, and I had to remind myself that though he moved well, Gibson was not a young man. He had not been a young man when his order commissioned him to tutor my father, who was himself nearing three hundred standard years. Gibson cupped a gnarled hand to one ear. &#x201c;What was that?&#x201d;<br><br>Turning, I spoke more plainly, straightening my back as I&#x2019;d been taught in order to better project. I was to be archon of that old castle in time, and speechcraft was a palatine&#x2019;s dearest weapon. &#x201c;I thought our lesson was later.&#x201d;<br><br>He could not have forgotten. Gibson forgot nothing, which would have been an extraordinary quality were it not the basest requirement for being what he was: a scholiast. His mind was trained to be a substitute for those daimon machines forbidden by the Chantry&#x2019;s holiest law, and so could not afford to forget. &#x201c;It is, Hadrian. Later, yes.&#x201d; He coughed into one viridian sleeve, eyed the camera drone that lurked near the vaulted ceiling. &#x201c;I was hoping I might have a word privately.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>The blunted backsword in my hand slipped a little. &#x201c;Now?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Before your brother and the castellan arrive, yes.&#x201d;<br><br>I turned and placed the sword back in its place between the rapiers and the sabers, spared the drone a glance myself, knowing full well that its optics were trained on me. I was the archon&#x2019;s eldest, after all, and so subject to as much protection&#x2014;and scrutiny&#x2014;as father was himself. There were places in Devil&#x2019;s Rest where two might have a truly private conversation, but none were near the training hall. &#x201c;Here?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In the cloister.&#x201d; Distracted a moment, Gibson looked down at my bare feet. &#x201c;No shoes?&#x201d;<br><br>Mine were not the feet of a pampered nobile. They looked more like the feet of some bondsman, with sheets of callous so thick I had taped the joints of my largest toes to keep the skin from tearing. &#x201c;Sir Felix says bare feet are best for training.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Does he now?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He says you&#x2019;re less likely to roll an ankle.&#x201d; I broke off, all too aware of the time. &#x201c;Our word . . . can&#x2019;t it wait? They should be here soon.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If it must.&#x201d; Gibson bobbed his head, short- fingered hands smoothing the front of his robe and its bronze sash. In my sparring clothes I felt shabby by comparison, though in truth his garments were plain: simple cotton, but well dyed to that hue that is greener than life itself.<br><br>The old scholiast was on the verge of saying more when the double doors to the training hall banged open and my brother appeared, grinning his lupine grin. Crispin was everything I was not: tall where I was short, strongly built where I was thin as a reed, square-faced where mine was pointed. For all that, our kinship was undeniable. We had the same ink-dark Marlowe hair, the same marble complexion, the same aquiline nose and steep eyebrows above the same violet eyes. We were clearly products of the same genetic constellation, our genomes altered in the same fashion to fit the same mold. The palatine houses&#x2014;greater and lesser&#x2014;went to extravagant lengths to craft such an image so that the learned could tell a house by the genetic markers of face and body as easily as by the devices worn on uniforms and painted on banners.<br><br>The craggy castellan, Sir Felix Martyn, followed in Crispin&#x2019;s wake, dressed in dueling leathers with his sleeves rolled past his elbows. He spoke first, raising a gloved hand. &#x201c;Oy! Here already?&#x201d;<br><br>I moved past Gibson to meet the two. &#x201c;Just stretching, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>The castellan inclined his head, scratching at his skein of tangled gray-black hair. &#x201c;Very good, then.&#x201d; He noticed Gibson for the first time. &#x201c;Tor Gibson!

The doors slammed, sending a temple-hushed <i>boom</i> through the vaulted hall. For half a moment, Crispin did a comic impression of Gibson&#x2019;s stooped, lurching step. I glared at him, and my brother had the good grace to look abashed, rubbing his palms over the coal-dark stubble on his scalp.<br><br>&#x201c;Shields at full charge?&#x201d; Felix asked, clapping his hands together with a dull, leathered snap. &#x201c;Very good.&#x201d;<br><br>In legend, the hero is almost always taught to fight by some sunstruck hermit, some mystic who sets his pupils to chasing cats, cleaning vehicles, and writing poetry. In Jadd, it is said that the swordmasters&#x2014;the Maeskoloi&#x2014;do all these things and might go for years before so much as touching a sword. Not I. Under Felix, my education was a rigor of unending drills. Many hours a day I spent in his care, learning to hold my own. No mysticism, only practice, long and tedious until the motions of lunge and parry were easy as breathing. For among the palatine nobility of the Sollan Empire&#x2014;both men and women&#x2014;skill with arms is accounted a chief virtue, not only because any of us might aspire to knighthood or to service in the Legions but because dueling served as a safety valve for the pressures and prejudices that might otherwise boil into vendettas. Thus any scion of any house might at some point be expected to take up arms in defense of her own honor or that of his house.<br><br>&#x201c;I still owe you for last time, you know,&#x201d; Crispin said when we had finished our drills and faced one another across the fencing round. His thick lips twisted into a jagged smile, making him look like nothing so much as the blunt instrument he was.<br><br>I smiled to match his, though on my face I hoped the effect was less swaggering. &#x201c;You have to hit me first.&#x201d;</p><h2>Cirque Du Freak: The Manga, Vol. 4: Vampire Mountain (Cirque Du Freak: The Manga, 4)</h2><p>Darren Shan and Mr. Crepsley embark on a dangerous trek to the very heart of the vampire world.

Jones reveals the little-known story of the CIA&#x2019;s subsequent operations in Poland, which produced a landmark victory for democracy during the Cold War. While the Soviet-backed Polish government worked to crush a budding liberal opposition movement, the CIA began a sophisticated intelligence campaign, code-named QRHELPFUL, that supported dissident groups. The most powerful of these groups was Solidarity, a trade union that swelled to a membership of ten million and became one of the first legitimate anti-Communist opposition movements in Eastern Europe. With President Reagan&#x2019;s support, the CIA provided money that helped Solidarity print newspapers, broadcast radio programs, and conduct a wide-ranging information warfare campaign against the Soviet-backed government. QRHELPFUL proved vital in establishing a free and democratic Poland.</p><p>Long overlooked by CIA historians and Reagan biographers, the story of QRHELPFUL features an extraordinary cast of characters&#x2015;including spymaster Bill Casey, CIA officer Richard Malzahn, Polish-speaking CIA case officer Celia Larkin, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, and Pope John Paul II.

I spent my growing-up years in the little town of Wyncote, which was just north of the city. Our house was across the road from a lovely and mysterious old farm, so I grew up with horses and cows and geese and chickens, along with hay and manure and all the smells and sounds of farming. In those days there were woods and fields all around our house. We lived in the couritry, but we were only an hour away from the city. Both places seemed exciting and dangerous to me, and full of romance and magic.</p><p>"Romance and magic were very important to me. Fairy tales, folktales, and myths were--and still are--my favorite things. I loved to read and draw pictures more than anything, but I hated school and was miserable there. I couldn't concentrate, and I always felt like a dummy, because I didn't understand the rules that everyone else seemed to know. I have to admit that I still feel that way sometimes. I did manage to graduate from high school, though, and then I went to an art school in Philadelphia instead of college. It was so much fun that I actually learned a lot.</p><p>"It was there that I found out about the great book illustrators of the early 1900s: Arthur Rackham, Edmund Dulac, and the crazy Pre-Raphaelites in England; and Howard Pyle, N. C. Wyeth, and the serious students of the Brandywine School here in American. Their romantic and magical storytelling pictures inspired me and gave me courage. I was determined to follow in the footsteps of these artists and to carry on their tradition.</p><p>"In 1959 I got married and left Philadelphia. I spent the next few years traveling and attending art schools in Boston and in Stockholm, Sweden. I learned about book design and printmiaking, and how to cook and do laundry. in Sweden I learned about the artists Carl Larsson, Jon Bauer, and Sulamith Wulfing, Whose work inspired and influenced me.</p><p>"In 1961 I 'Illustrated my very first children's book, for a Swedish publisher. The editor who gave me the job was Astrid Lindgren, the author of the <em>Pippi Longstocking</em> books. Since then, I have illustrated about 150 books, give or take a few. I've tried to make each and every book special and beautiful. I've put a lot of myself my beliefs and interests, my friends and family and the places I've been -- into my pictures.

Making his way to Paris at the end of World War II, Cl�bert took to living on the streets, and in <i>Paris Vagabond</i>, a so-called &#x201c;aleatory novel&#x201d; assembled out of sketches he jotted down at the time, he tells what it was like. His &#x201c;gallery of faces and cityscapes on the road to extinction&#x201d; is an astonishing depiction of a world apart&#x2014;a Paris, long since vanished, of the poor, the criminal, and the outcast&#x2014;and a no less astonishing feat of literary improvisation: Its long looping breathless sentences, streetwise, profane, lyrical, incantatory, are an adventure in their own right. Praised on publication by the great novelist and poet Blaise Cendrars and embraced by the young Situationists as a kind of manual for living off the grid, <i>Paris Vagabond</i>&#x2014;here published with the starkly striking photographs of Cl�bert&#x2019;s friend Patrice Molinard&#x2014;is a raw and celebratory evocation of the life of a city and the underside of life.</p><p><b>Jean-Paul Cl�bert</b> (1926&#x2013;2011) ran away from his Jesuit boarding school at the age of seventeen to join the French Re�sistance, serving undercover in a Montmartre brothel to gather intelligence on the patrons who were German soldiers. After the liberation of Paris he wandered through a catalog of odd jobs including boat painter, cook, newspaper seller, funeral director&#x2019;s mute, and caf� proprietor. For many months he lived with the city&#x2019;s down-and-outs, though without losing touch with some of Paris&#x2019;s literary figures, notably Blaise Cendrars, and gathered the raw material for this book, first published in 1952 as <i>Paris insolite</i>. In 1956 he moved to Provence, where he remained for the rest of his life, writing many books, including a classic firsthand study of Gypsy life, originally published in 1961 and translated by Charles Duff as <i>The Gypsies</i>; and the encyclopedic <i>Dictionnaire du Surr�alisme</i> (1996).<br><br> <b>Patrice Molinard</b> (1922&#x2013;2002) began his career taking stills for Georges Franju&#x2019;s legendary documentary on the Paris slaughterhouse at La Villette, <i>Le sang des b�tes</i> (1949). As a film director, he is best known for <i>Fantasmagorie</i> (1963), <i>Orph�e 70</i> (1968), and <i>Bistrots de Paris</i> (1977).&nbsp;<br><br> <b>Donald Nicholson-Smith </b>was born in Manchester, England and is a longtime resident of New York City.

She is the last defender of the Celtic culture in Britain; the only woman openly to lead her warriors into battle and to stand successfully against the might of Imperial Rome -- and triumph.<br><br>It is 33 AD and eleven-year-old Breaca (later named Boudica), the red-haired daughter of one of the leaders of the Eceni tribe, is on the cusp between girl and womanhood. She longs to be a Dreamer, a mystical leader who can foretell the future, but having killed the man who has attacked and killed her mother, she has proven herself a warrior. <b>Dreaming the Eagle</b> is also the story of the two men Boudica loves most: Caradoc, outstanding warrior and inspirational leader; and B�n, her half-brother, who longs to be a warrior, though he is manifestly a Dreamer, possibly the finest in his tribe&#x2019;s history. B�n becomes the Druid whose eventual return to the Celts is Boudica&#x2019;s salvation.<br><br><b>Dreaming the Eagle</b> is full of brilliantly realised, luminous scenes as the narrative sweeps effortlessly from the epic -- where battle scenes are huge, bloody, and action-packed -- to the intimate. Manda Scott plunges us into the unforgettable world of tribal Britain in the years before the Roman invasion: a world of druids and dreamers and the magic of the gods where the natural world is as much a character as any of the people who live within it, a world of warriors who fight for honour as much as victory, a world of passion, courage and spectacular heroism pitched against overwhelming odds.<br><br><b>Dreaming the Eagle</b> stunningly recreates the roots of a story so powerful its impact has lasted through the ages.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s amazing to me about this tale of Boudica, Britain&#x2019;s legendary female warrior, is the pitch-perfect fluency with which Manda Scott brings it forth . . . like an eyewitness recounting real events that she saw and participated in. Her reimagining of this age, when the tribes of Britain clashed with the legions of Rome, includes interior monologues, multiple points of view, dreams, visions, ecstasies, and interlocutions with the dead, all of it utterly convincing and compelling. . . .

Around the world, telegraph systems crashed, machines burst into flames, and electric shocks rendered operators unconscious. Compasses and other sensitive instruments reeled as if struck by a massive magnetic fist. For the first time, people began to suspect that the Earth was not isolated from the rest of the universe. However, nobody knew what could have released such strange forces upon the Earth--nobody, that is, except the amateur English astronomer Richard Carrington.</p><br><p> In this riveting account, Stuart Clark tells for the first time the full story behind Carrington's observations of a mysterious explosion on the surface of the Sun and how his brilliant insight--that the Sun's magnetism directly influences the Earth--helped to usher in the modern era of astronomy. Clark vividly brings to life the scientists who roundly rejected the significance of Carrington's discovery of solar flares, as well as those who took up his struggle to prove the notion that the Earth could be touched by influences from space. Clark also reveals new details about the sordid scandal that destroyed Carrington's reputation and led him from the highest echelons of science to the very lowest reaches of love, villainy, and revenge.</p><br><br><p> <i>The Sun Kings</i> transports us back to Victorian England, into the very heart of the great nineteenth-century scientific controversy about the Sun's hidden influence over our planet.</p></p><p><p>"In this sprightly and spirited narrative, a few determined scientists set out to correlate the pattern of dark spots on the Sun's face with the igniting of earthly aurora, the interruption of telegraph (later satellite) transmissions, and even the price of wheat in England. Of course, the world thought them mad. The 'sun kings,' as Stuart Clark so aptly names these pioneers, persevered through ridicule, animosity, and personal tragedy to forge a link across space and fathom the true nature of the Sun. I found myself captivated by the characters, the colossal problems they tackled, and the stunning conclusions they finally reached. I commend Clark for combining so many interesting ideas into a single, fast-paced, beautifully crafted story."--<b>Dava Sobel, author of <i>Longitude, Galileo's Daughter, and The Planets</i></b></p><p>"Herein lies the tale of intrepid astronomers, across time and cultures, who were the first to observe, identify, and document our misbehaving Sun. But by the time you are done, you realize that the story's main protagonist--the one with all the personality-is not any one of the scientists, but the Sun itself. A delightful, informative read."--<b>Neil deGrasse Tyson, astrophysicist, American Museum of Natural History, author of <i>Death by Black Hole: And Other Cosmic Quandaries</i></b></p><p>"Stuart Clark illuminates the dawn of astrophysics by tracing the rise and fall of Richard Carrington, the man who first glimpsed how events on the Sun affect our lives on Earth. No faceless automatons, the scientists in this tale blend a passion for their work with the more worldly passions of pride, jealousy, greed, and lust."--<b>Robert P. Kirshner, Clowes Professor of Science, Harvard University</b></p><p>"Stuart Clark's <i>The Sun Kings</i> is undoubtedly the most gripping and brilliant popular-science history account that I have ever read. It is informative, accurate, and relevant. Clark's ability to write so vividly makes me seethe with jealousy."--<b>Owen Gingerich, author of <i>The Book Nobody Read: Chasing the Revolutions of Nicolaus Copernicus</i></b></p><p>"Clark tells a gripping story with several intersecting personal dramas that make unexpectedly exciting reading for a book with such a substantial academic theme. I learned a thing or two about how it was first realized and then proved--over the objection of the powerful Lord Kelvin--that the magnetism thrown off the Sun reaches the Earth. Those not familiar with the overall story will benefit even more from the discussion and analysis."--<b>Jay M.

His narrative barely acknowledges the enormous difficulty of developing effective antivirals, the self-criticisms by government agencies and researchers charged with handling AIDS, or the ethical dilemmas encountered in distributing unapproved drugs. He also seems unaware or dismissive of the role that human frailty plays in the politics of science and business.

Lib., Boston</i><br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.Business Week writer Nussbaum blames the failure to find a drug effective against AIDS on an unholy alliance forged among the National Institutes of Health, the FDA, elite biomedical centers and the big drug companies. AZT, the toxic, immunosuppressive anti-AIDS drug developed by Burroughs Wellcome, probably offers only short-term, transitory benefits to some patients, he charges. A hard-hitting, shocking look at profit-oriented AIDS research, this brisk journalistic account also tours a medical underground in which grass-roots organizations offer various unapproved drugs to people with AIDS. In this informal network, claims Nussbaum ( The World After Oil ), a model for quick testing of drugs is emerging that, if widely implemented, could revolutionize the treatment of other diseases.

Reprint.</p><p>Imagine Nevada Barr's delight in discovering that there is actually a national park right smack in the middle of New York City--Gateways Park, which encompasses Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty. She could continue her splendid series about park ranger Anna Pigeon and still do some serious shopping at Bendel's and Berghdorf's, the kind of stores you don't find in the New Mexico cave setting of <i>Blind Descent</i> (her last adventure). The ploy works: Barr is probably the only mystery writer who could see a natural environment under New York's slick and sleazy skin. <p> Anna is in Manhattan to look after her sister Molly, seriously ill with pneumonia and a kidney infection. Pigeon moves in with a ranger friend who has a place on Ellis Island. There's not much natural wildlife unless you count her feathered namesakes, but she still manages to find a lot to contemplate--especially the suspicious suicide of a teenage girl who leaps from Liberty's ledge, followed not long after by the security guard who tried to stop her. But Anna's snooping puts her own life in jeopardy. She survives several attacks and a near drowning--events as frightening as any of the fires, floods, and hurricanes from her past adventures. Barr neatly ties up her plot--ending with a brilliant chase scene across the waters from Manhattan to Liberty Island. What next for Anna? Is there a national park in Las Vegas? <i>--Dick Adler</i></p>There is peril beneath the watchful eyes of the Lady...<p>When Anna Pigeon left New York City after her husband was killed, she hoped it would be forever. But now her sister Molly is clinging to life in an uptown hospital ICU, so Anna has reluctantly returned, Rooming with a friend and fellow park ranger in close quarters on Liberty Island -- the small strip of land that is home to Lady Liberty -- Anna spends her free time exploring the grand monument and the crumbliing, overgrown, and eerie ruins in the unrestored sections of nearby Ellis Island. But the peace she seeks here is shattered when she finds herself among a crowd gathered at the Lady's base, staring at the broken body of a teenager who fell -- or was pushed -- to her death.</p><p>The reason behind the young girl's fatal plunge is not the only mystery alive on these historic sites -- nor will hers be the only death. Hidden in a dangerous labyrinth of stone, glass, and steel are secrets Anna Pigeon is now compelled to uncover...and an insidious threat to herself and to others that could wreak havoc on a nation's proudest day.</p></p><h2>Eric (Discworld)</h2><p>In an attempt to have three wishes granted--to be immortal, to rule the world, and to have the world&#39;s most beautiful woman fall in love with him--Eric, an inept demonologist, summons up Rincewind, the universe&#39;s most incompetent wizard, to help him.</p><p>Sir Terry Pratchett is a publishing phenomenon. Among his many prizes and citations are the World Fantasy Life Achievement Award, the Carnegie Medal, the BSFA Award, eight honorary doctorates and, of course, a knighthood. In 2012, he won a BAFTA for his documentary on the subject of assisted suicide, &#39;Terry Pratchett: Choosing to Die&#39;. He is the author of fifty bestselling books but is best known for the globally renowned Discworld series. The first Discworld novel, The Colour of Magic, was published in 1983, and the series is still going strong almost three decades later. Four Discworld novels - Hogfather, Going Postal, The Colour of Magic and The Light Fantastic - have been adapted for television, with more to follow. His books have sold approximately 85 million copies worldwide (but who&#39;s counting?), and been translated into thirty-seven languages. In 2007, Terry Pratchett was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer&#39;s Disease. He died in 2015.The latest in Pratchett's Discworld series plays a variation on the Faust theme. Eric is a singularly inept sorcerer who conjures up an even more inept wizard, Rincewind, and a sentient (also treacherous, vindictive, and unruly) footlocker named, of course, the Luggage. Not having got anything like what he bargained for, Eric is fated to go through the usual zany ordeals of a Pratchett protagonist, until he wishes he'd never been born. Nor do things really all work out in the end, even if Eric is better off than he expected to be through most of the book. The Discworld books are building a following that is beginning to resemble that of Piers Anthony's Xanth stories, although it can be said that Pratchett is rather more sophisticated than Anthony. In any case, there should be a lot of readers for this one. Fantasy collections, provide accordingly. <i>Roland Green</i></p><h2>Mindfulness and Social Work</h2><p>For the first time ever, a book has been written tying mindfulness techniques to social work practice.

Contrasting the Enlightenments in the three nations, Gertrude Himmelfarb demonstrates the primacy of the British and the wisdom and foresight of thinkers such as Adam Smith, David Hume, Thomas Paine, the Earl of Shaftesbury, Edward Gibbon, and Edmund Burke, who established its unique character and historic importance. It is this Enlightenment, she argues, that created a moral and social philosophy&#x2013;humane, compassionate, and realistic&#x2013;that still resonates strongly today, in America perhaps even more so than in Europe.<br><br>This is an illuminating contribution to the history of ideas.</p><p>Gertrude Himmelfarb taught for twenty-three years at Brooklyn College and the Graduate School of the City University of New York, where she was named Distinguished Professor of History in 1978. Now Professor Emeritus, she lives with her husband, Irving Kristol, in Washington, D.C. Her previous books include <b>The De-Moralization of Society: From Victorian Virtues to Modern Values; On Looking into the Abyss: Untimely Thoughts on Culture and Society; Poverty and Compassion: The Moral Imagination of the Late Victorians; The New History and the Old; Marriage and Morals Among the Victorians; The Idea of Poverty: England in <br>the Early Industrial Age; On Liberty and Liberalism: The Case of John Stuart Mill; Victorian Minds (nominated for a National Book Award); Darwin and the Darwinian Revolution;</b> and <b>Lord Acton: A Study in Conscience and Politics.</b><b>1. "Social Affections" and Religious Dispositions</b><br><br>The British did not have "philosophes." They had "moral philosophers," a very different breed. Those historians who belittle or dismiss the idea of a British Enlightenment do so because they do not recognize the features of the philosophes in the moral philosophers--and with good reason: the physiognomy is quite different.<br><br>It is ironic that the French should have paid tribute to John Locke and Isaac Newton as the guiding spirits of their own Enlightenment, while the British, although respectful of both, had a more ambiguous relationship with them. Newton was eulogized by David Hume as "the greatest and rarest genius that ever rose for the ornament and instruction of the species,"[1] and by Alexander Pope in the much quoted epitaph: "Nature and Nature's laws lay hid in night;/God said, Let Newton be! and all was light." But Pope's An Essay on Man sent quite a different message: "The proper study of mankind is man" implied that materialism and science could penetrate into the mysteries of nature but not of man. In an earlier essay, the allusion to Newton was more obvious; it was human nature, not astronomy, Pope said, that was "the most useful object of humane reason," and it was "of more consequence to adjust the true nature and measures of right and wrong, than to settle the distance of the planets and compute the times of their circumvolutions."[2] While Newton received the adulation of his countrymen (he was master of the Royal Mint and president of the Royal Society, was knighted, and given a state funeral), and his scientific methodology was much praised, he had little substantive influence on the moral philosophers or on the issues that dominated the British Enlightenment. (His Opticks, on the other hand, was an inspiration for poets, who were entranced by the images and metaphors of light.)[3]<br><br>John Locke, too, was a formidable presence in eighteenth-century Britain, a best-selling author and a revered figure. But among the moral philosophers he was admired more for his politics than for his metaphysics. Indeed, the basic tenets of their philosophy implied a repudiation of his. What made them "moral philosophers" rather than "philosophers" tout court was their belief in a "moral sense" that was presumed to be if not innate in the human mind (as Francis Hutcheson thought), then so entrenched in the human sensibility, in the form of sympathy or "fellow-feeling" (as Adam Smith and David Hume had it), as to have the same compelling force as innate ideas.<br><br>Locke himself could not have been more explicit in rejecting innate ideas, whether moral or metaphysical. The mind, as he understood it, so far from being inhabited by innate ideas, was a tabula rasa, to be filled by sensations and experiences, and by the reflections rising from those sensations and experiences. The title of the first chapter of his Essay Concerning Human Understanding was "No Innate Speculative Principles" (that is, epistemological principles); the second, "No Innate Practical Principles" (moral principles). Even the golden rule, that "most unshaken rule of morality and foundation of all social virtue," would have been meaningless to one who had never heard that maxim and who might well ask for a reason justifying it, which "plainly shows it not to be innate." If virtue was generally approved, it was not because it was innate, but because it was "profitable," conducive to one's self-interest and happiness, the promotion of pleasure and the avoidance of pain. Thus, things could be judged good or evil only by reference to pleasure or pain, which were themselves the product of sensation.[4]<br><br>Locke's Essay was published in 1690. Nine years later, the Earl of Shaftesbury wrote an essay that was, in effect, a refutation of Locke. This, too, had its ironies, for this Shaftesbury, the third earl, was brought up in the household of his grandfather, the first earl, who was a devotee of Locke and had employed him to supervise the education of his grandchildren. It was this experience that had inspired Locke's Thoughts Concerning Education--and inspired as well, perhaps, the pupil's rejection of his master's teachings.[5] Shaftesbury's essay, "An Inquiry Concerning Virtue, or Merit," was published (without his permission but to great acclaim) in 1699 and reprinted in 1711 in somewhat revised form in his Characteristics of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times. That three-volume work, reissued posthumously three years later and in ten more editions in the course of the century, rivalled Locke's Second Treatise (a political, not metaphysical tract) as the most frequently reprinted work of the time. The hundred-page essay on virtue was the centerpiece of those volumes.<br><br>Virtue, according to Shaftesbury, derived not from religion, self-interest, sensation, or reason. All of these were instrumental in supporting or hindering virtue, but were not the immediate or primary source of it. What was "antecedent" to these was the "moral sense," the "sense of right and wrong."[6] [Shaftesbury's "moral sense" was very different from John Rawls's recent use of that term. For Shaftesbury it was an innate sense of right and wrong; for Rawls it is an intuitive conviction of the rightness of freedom and equality.] It was this sense that was "predominant...inwardly joined to us, and implanted in our nature," "a first principle in our constitution and make," as natural as "natural affection itself."[7] This "natural affection," moreover, was "social affection," an affection for "society and the public," which, so far from being at odds with one's private interest, or "self-affection," actually contributed to one's personal pleasure and happiness.[8] A person whose actions were motivated entirely or even largely by self-affection--by self-love, self-interest, or self-good--was not virtuous. Indeed, he was "in himself still vicious," for the virtuous man was motivated by nothing other than "a natural affection for his kind."[9]<br><br>This was not a Rousseauean idealization of human nature, of man before being corrupted by society. Nor was it a Pollyannaish expectation that all or even most men would behave virtuously all or most of the time. The moral sense attested to the sense of right and wrong in all men, the knowledge of right and wrong even when they chose to do wrong. Indeed, a good part of Shaftesbury's essay dealt with the variety of "hateful passions"--envy, malice, cruelty, lust--that beset mankind. Even virtue, Shaftesbury warned, could become vice when it was pursued to excess; an immoderate degree of "tenderness," for example, destroyed the "effect of love," and excessive "pity" rendered a man "incapable of giving succour."[10] The conclusion of the essay was a stirring testament of an ethic that, by its very nature--the "common nature" of man--was a social ethic: "Thus the wisdom of what rules, and is first and chief in nature, has made it to be according to the private interest and good of everyone to work towards the general good; which if a creature ceases to promote, he is actually so far wanting to himself and ceases to promote his own happiness and welfare.... And, thus, Virtue is the good, and Vice the ill of everyone."[11]<br><br>The contrast, not only with Thomas Hobbes but with Locke as well, could not be more obvious.[12] Neither was explicitly named by Shaftesbury, perhaps out of respect for Locke, who was still alive when the essay was written (although he had died by the time it was reissued). But no knowledgeable reader could have mistaken Shaftesbury's intention. In 1709 he wrote to one of his young proteges that Locke, even more than Hobbes, was the villain of the piece, for Hobbes's character and base slavish principles of government "took off the poison of his philosophy," whereas Locke's character and commendable principles of government made his philosophy even more reprehensible.<br><br> 'Twas Mr. Locke that struck at all fundamentals, threw all order and virtue out of the world.... Virtue, according to Mr. Locke, has no other measure, law, or rule, than fashion and custom: morality, justice, equity, depend only on law and will.... And thus neither right nor wrong, virtue nor vice are any thing in themselves; nor is there any trace or idea of them naturally imprinted on human minds. Experience and our catechism teach us all![13]<br><br> As Shaftesbury did not mention Locke in the Inquiry, so Bernard Mandeville did not mention Shaftesbury in The Fable of the Bees--at least not in the first edition, published in 1714. But appearing just then, a year after Shaftesbury's death and at the same time as the second edition of the Characteristics, Mandeville's readers might well take it as a rebuttal to Shaftesbury's work. The subtitle, Private Vices, Public Benefits, reads like a manifesto contra Shaftesbury.[14]<br><br>The original version of the Fable, published in 1705 as a sixpenny pamphlet (and pirated, Mandeville complained, in a halfpenny sheet), consisted of some thirty verses depicting a society, a hive of bees, where everyone was a knave, and where knavery served a valuable purpose. Every vice had its concomitant virtue: avarice contributed to prodigality, luxury to industry, folly to ingenuity. The result was a "grumbling" but productive hive, where "...every part was full of Vice,/ Yet the whole mass a Paradise." A well-intentioned attempt to rid the hive of vice had the effect of ridding it of its virtues as well, resulting in the destruction of the hive itself, as all the bees, "blest with content and honesty," abandoned industry and...</p><h2>The Best Nest (Beginner Books(R))</h2><p>Illus. in full color.

Born into a powerful Wyoming political family, John Perry Barlow wrote the lyrics for thirty Grateful Dead songs while also running his family&#x2019;s cattle ranch. He hung out in Andy Warhol&#x2019;s Factory, went on a date with the Dalai Lama&#x2019;s sister, and accidentally shot Bob Weir in the face on the eve of his own wedding. As a favor to Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Barlow mentored a young JFK Jr. and the two then became lifelong friends. Despite being a freely self-confessed acidhead, he served as Dick Cheney&#x2019;s campaign manager during Cheney&#x2019;s first run for Congress. And after befriending a legendary early group of computer hackers known as the Legion of Doom, Barlow became a renowned internet guru who then cofounded the groundbreaking Electronic Frontier Foundation.<br><br>His r�sum� only hints of the richness of a life lived on the edge. Blessed with an incredible sense of humor and a unique voice, Barlow was a born storyteller in the tradition of Mark Twain and Will Rogers. Through intimate portraits of friends and acquaintances from Bob Weir and Jerry Garcia to Timothy Leary and Steve Jobs, <i>Mother American Night</i> traces the generational passage by which the counterculture became the culture, and it shows why learning to accept love may be the hardest thing we ever ask of ourselves.</p><p><b>John Perry Barlow</b> was a cattle rancher, a former lyricist for the Grateful Dead, and cofounder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

If you can accept love, you can do damn near everything else. Giving love is easy and so most people go about thinking that they&#x2019;re fully capable in the love department because they can give it. But as I have learned, that is not the case, and how could it be? If you&nbsp;don&#x2019;t accept it, where are you going to get love to give?</p><p>My mentor in this regard is the only person I&#x2019;ve ever met in my life who can seamlessly accept love: Gilberto Gil, the great musician and former minister of culture in Brazil. For him, it appears to be effortless. Since I would say that he is the most beloved person in the most loving country on the planet, it&#x2019;s very lucky for him and them that he can accept it so easily.</p><p>On April 16, 2015, Gil was performing at Davies Symphony Hall in San Francisco. On my way back from Huntsville, Texas where I had been lured to give a speech, I spent hours tramping around the Atlanta airport in a brand new pair of cowboy boots while waiting for a flight that would get me back home in time for Gil&#x2019;s show.</p><p>For years, I had been getting my boots from the Olathe boot company in Kansas. They were made of Norwegian elk leather, which is especially pliant and so could accommodate a bunion I have on my left foot that somebody once said should be in the Boone and Crockett big game trophy book of bunions if there had been one.</p><p>I already had about ten pairs of these boots that had been kept in walking condition by a wizard in San Francisco who said he could re- store any cowboy boot that had ever been made and by golly, he could. But I had not been to see him for a while and in an act of desperation, I bought a pair of Norwegian elk boots from another company. Although they were not pliant, I said to myself, &#x201c;How bad could they be during a short trip?&#x201d;</p><p>Although I arrived in San Francisco too late to see him perform, Gil and I did then go back to the Mark Hopkins hotel where the two of us sat up all night long talking in the lobby by ourselves. It was a rich moment, and an ironic one as well, because at the time, I had no idea whatsoever that I was about to embark on the greatest experience I could ever imagine in terms of teaching me how to accept love.</p><p>Having worn a gigantic hole in the index toe of my left foot by walking for hours through the Atlanta airport in those brand new boots, I woke up the next morning, which also happened to be the twenty-first anniversary of the worst day of my life, with a raging staph infection in my bloodstream. One thing led to another and I then contracted a second bacterial infection that set up camp in some hardware in my back. Suddenly, I couldn&#x2019;t walk. I was also not producing any red blood cells, and so they transferred me up to UCSF in San Francisco, where they stabilized my bone marrow.</p><p>While I was at UCSF, the doctor who had installed that hardware cleaned out the bacteria that had attacked it. I had no way of conveying to him that I was on an heroic amount of blood thinners to prevent a pulmonary embolism, and in the process, he created a hematoma that put a large blood clot about the size and shape of two golf balls between my spinal cord and the epidural sheath. They had to open me right back up at four o&#x2019;clock in the morning to get it out of there. I had gone under the knife with him several times before, so I just had to be positive and trust him.</p><p>Before he did this, he said, &#x201c;John Perry, I gotta tell you. I don&#x2019;t know what I&#x2019;m going to find when I get in there, but I think unfortunately that there is a pretty good chance that I&#x2019;m not going to be able to save any of your functions below T11.&#x201d; In other words, I would be paralyzed from my belly button down. I said, &#x201c;You mean I&#x2019;ll never dance again?&#x201d; And he said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure, but I think if you had one working eyelid, you&#x2019;d still dance.&#x201d; Which remains one of the best compliments I&#x2019;ve ever received.</p><p>So I went in there knowing there was a good chance that I was going to come out unable to walk again. When I woke up in the recovery room, my doctor was standing at the end of my bed and he said, &#x201c;John Perry, move your toes.&#x201d; I did. And he started to cry. Because he had no idea if I was going to be able to do that and there was the only way to find out.</p><p>I was recovering from that when they decided they needed to be on the outlook for pulmonary embolisms, so they installed a filter in my vena cava to remove all the phlebitis-style clots from my blood- stream. In what I later learned was yet another iatrogenic failure, they displaced something that lodged itself in what had previously been my main coronary artery.</p><p>Later that evening, I was in the middle of an extremely stressful phone conversation with my business partner, who had been instrumental in getting us the money for our pure water project, when I started feeling pain in my chest. I didn&#x2019;t know what to do about it at first and finally said, &#x201c;I believe I&#x2019;ve got to get off this call, I may be having a heart attack.&#x201d;</p><p>And in fact, the lower two ventricles of my heart had just stopped dead in their tracks and I had no heartbeat. So they hauled me off from the company of my daughter Leah and several other folks who had a pretty hard time taking in this spectacle. They took me to a side room and hit me with the paddles. Just like on TV. Nothing. They hit me again with the paddles with twice as much voltage. Nothing. Then they hit me the third time with so much energy that they burned my chest. But it still didn&#x2019;t start my heart.</p><p>Then an amazing thing happened. A young resident grabbed my arm, yanked me off the gurney, flung me to the floor, and jumped on my sternum with both of his knees. And my heart kind of went, &#x201c;Well, if you&#x2019;re going to be like that about it, I guess I&#x2019;ll start beating again.&#x201d; It was like the cowboy heart reaction. &#x201c;You <i>hit </i>me, you son of a bitch!&#x201d; If people code out for eight minutes like I did and then come back, they usually do so as a different person than the one who left. But I guess my brain doesn&#x2019;t use all that much oxygen because I appeared to be the same guy, at least from the inside. For eight minutes, however, I had not just been gratefully dead, I had been plain, flat out, ordinary dead. It was then I decided the time had finally come for me to begin working on my book. Looking for a ghost writer was not really the issue. At the time, my main concern was to not be a ghost before the book itself was done.</p><p>What amazed me most about this entire incident was that after so many years of thinking I really understood what happened when you died, I had not seen a goddamn thing. No upwardly sweeping rivers of light, no angels, no cherubim, no seraphim, no celestial beings. It all just went black. I&#x2019;d gone down the tunnel of eternity and it had turned out to be nothing more than a cheap carnival ride to nowhere.</p><p>When I told my old friend and songwriting partner Bob Weir about this, he looked at me and said, &#x201c;Well, it could be that you just weren&#x2019;t dead enough.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>Adios, America</h2><p>Ann Coulter is back, more fearless than ever.

Guggenheim Museum, New York, in the summer of 1998, this work aims to capture the spirit of the motorcycle and the passion and excitement it has aroused in film, literature, television, and on the road. It depicts 100 models from the first - the 1885 Daimler Einspur - to recent concept bikes. Among those selected on both technical and aesthetic grounds are the 1894 Hildebrand &amp; Wolfmuller 1500cc, the pivotal BMW R32, the late-1920s four-passenger Boehmerland/Czechie, the popular 1950s Honda 50 Super Cub, the quintessentially American 1977 Harley Davidson XLCR, and the Ducati 916. Each bike is described in detail, and the book also contains essays which discuss motorcycle-related films, fashion, life-style and history.</p><p><i>The Art of the Motorcycle</i> begins with a serious preface by Guggenheim director Thomas Krens, who calls the motorcycle "a quintessential symbol of the insecurity and optimism of our time." At 411 pages long (an ll-page, single-spaced bibliography of motorcycle books carries it over the top), it is a hefty compendium of motorcycle history, culture, design, and science. While the essays range from treatises to such fun stuff as "Bikes were always work for me," a long poem by Dennis Hopper, this thoroughgoing tome is above all a meticulous catalogue of the 96 motorcycles exhibited at the Guggenheim Museum during the summer of 1998, with details about engine design as well as esthetics. "Another significant innovation is the machine's throttle-controlled oiler," we read of the 1911 electric-orange Flying Merkel Model V. "Lubrication was a continuing problem in the early days ... but Merkel's system ... preceded by nearly two decades both Indian's as well as Harley-Davidson's adoption of this feature." The bikes are documented with crystal-clear photographs in this precision-built book. <i>--Peggy Moorman</i></p><h2>Aftermath: Thieves&#39; World, Book 10</h2><p>Tempus and the Stepsons abandon the embattled city of Sanctuary as rival factions emerge and a vicious power struggle begins, in a collection of interrelated fantasy tales by Janet Morris, John Brunner, David Drake, Andrew Ojjutt, and others</p><p></p><h2>Self-Esteem Affirmations</h2><p>Contains a series of positive affirmations that can help you experience the joy, fulfillment, love, and wonder that are present in you right now.</p><p>Louise Hay was an inspirational teacher who educated millions since the 1984 publication of her bestseller You Can Heal Your Life, which has more than 50 million copies in print worldwide.

Even when they first slept together Button had no idea who Mercury was, and when the star told him his name it meant nothing to him. Hutton worked as a barber at the Savoy Hotel and retained his job and his lodgings in Sutton, Surrey, for two years after moving in with Mercury, and then worked as his gardener. He was never fully assimilated into Mercury&#39;s jet-setting lifestyle, nor did he want to be, but from 1985 until Mercury&#39;s death in 1991 he was closer to him than anyone and knew all Mercury&#39;s closest friends: the other members of Queen, Elton John, David Bowie, Phil Collins to name a few. Ever present at the countless Sunday lunch gatherings and opulent parties, Hutton has a wealth of anecdotes about as well as a deep understanding of, Mercury&#39;s life. He also nursed Mercury through his terminal illness, often held him throughout the night in his final weeks, and was with him as he died. No one can tell the story of the last few years of Mercury&#39;s private life - the ecstasies and the agonies - more accurately or honestly than Jim Hutton.</p><p></p><h2>The Ultimate Book of Lighthouses: History, Legend, Lore, Design, Technology, Romance</h2><p>The sheer beauty of the elegant, lonely lighthouses along our shores&#x2014;and their unspoiled, scenic natural settings&#x2014;has captivated our collective imagination.

Walker Jameson, a veteran who survived hazardous duty during the first Iraq war, has managed against all odds to escape from California's Terminal Island Penitentiary. Jameson soon begins to leave a trail of bodies in his wake, and in order to forestall further slaughter, Rackley and his team must figure out why the prisoner broke out with only a short time left on his five-year sentence for stockpiling explosives. The clues point to a connection to the suicide of Jameson's sister, Theresa, who was seeking a new miracle drug manufactured by a powerful pharmaceutical company that offered the only ray of hope for her sick child.

The introduction provides criticsim, covering themes, characters and dramatic structure, and helpful notes are provided at the right level on every page, facing the text.</p><p>The Tempest is one of Shakespeare&#39;s most suggestive, yet most elusive plays. It is a magical romance, yet deeply embedded in seventeenth-century debates about authority and power. This edition attends to the implications of Prospero&#39;s magic, his political and paternal ambitions, and the controversial issue of his &#39;colonialist&#39; control of Caliban. The Tempest was also Shakespeare&#39;s response to the new opportunities offered by the Blackfriars theatre, and careful attention is given to the play&#39;s dramatic form, stage-craft, and use of music and spectacle, to demonstrate its uniquely experimental nature.This joyous play, the last comedy of Shakespeare&#39;s career, sums up his stagecraft with a display of seemingly effortless skill. Prospero, exiled Duke of Milan, living on an enchanted island, has the opportunity to punish and forgive his enemies when he raises a tempest that drives them ashore--as well as to forestall a rebellion, to arrange the meeting of his daughter, Miranda, with an eminently suitable young prince, and, more important, to relinquish his magic powers in recognition of his advancing age. Richly filled with music and magic, romance and comedy, the play&#39;s theme of love and reconciliation offers a splendid feast for the senses and the heart.</p><h2>My Father&#39;s Tears and Other Stories</h2><p>John Updike&#x2019;s first collection of new short fiction since the year 2000, <i>My Father&#x2019;s Tears</i> finds the author in a valedictory mood as he mingles narratives of his native Pennsylvania with stories of New England suburbia and of foreign travel.<br><br>&#x201c;Personal Archaeology&#x201d; considers life as a sequence of half-buried layers, and &#x201c;The Full Glass&#x201d; distills a lifetime&#x2019;s happiness into one brimming moment of an old man&#x2019;s bedtime routine. High-school class reunions, in &#x201c;The Walk with Elizanne&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Road Home,&#x201d; restore their hero to youth&#x2019;s commonwealth where, as the narrator of the title story confides, &#x201c;the self I value is stored, however infrequently I check on its condition.&#x201d; Exotic locales encountered in the journeys of adulthood include Morocco, Florida, Spain, Italy, and India. The territory of childhood, with its fundamental, formative mysteries, is explored in &#x201c;The Guardians,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Laughter of the Gods,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Kinderszenen.&#x201d; Love&#x2019;s fumblings among the bourgeoisie yield the tart comedy of &#x201c;Free,&#x201d; &#x201c;Delicate Wives,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Apparition,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Outage.&#x201d;<br><br>In sum, American experience from the Depression to the aftermath of 9/11 finds reflection in these glittering pieces of observation, remembrance, and imagination.</p><p>John Updike<b> </b>was born in 1932, in Shillington, Pennsylvania. He graduated from Harvard College in 1954, and spent a year in Oxford, England, at the Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art. From 1955 to 1957 he was a member of the staff of <i>The New Yorker</i> and since 1957 has lived in Massachusetts. He is the father of four children and the author of more than sixty books, including collections of short stories, poems, and criticism. His books have won the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award, the American Book Award, the National Book Critics Circle Award, the PEN/Faulkner Award, and the Howells Medal, among other honors. He died in January 2009.Morocco<br><br>The seacoast road went smoothly up and down, but compared with an American highway it was eerily empty. Other cars appeared menacing on it, approaching like bullets, straddling the center strip. Along the roadside, alone in all that sunswept space, little girls in multicolored Berber costume held out bouquets of flowers&#x2014;violets? poppies?&#x2014;which we were afraid to stop and accept. What were we afraid of? A trap. Bandits. Undertipping, or overtipping. Not knowing enough French, and no Arabic or Berber. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t stop, Daddy, don&#x2019;t!&#x201d; was the cry; and it was true, when we did stop at markets, interested persons out of the local landscape would gather about our rented Renault, peering in and offering unintelligible invitations.<br><br>We were an American family living in England in 1969 and had come to Morocco na�vely thinking it would be, in April, as absolute an escape to the sun as a trip to the Caribbean from the Eastern United States would be at the same time of year.<br><br>But Restinga, where a British travel agency as innocent as we of climatic realities had sent us, was deserted and windy. The hotel, freshly built by decree of the progressive, tourism-minded king, was semicircular in shape. At night, doors in the curving corridors slammed, and a solitary guard in a burnoose kept watch over the vacant rooms and the strange family of pre-season Americans. By day, the waves were too choppy to swim in, and the Mediterranean was not so much wine-dark as oil-black. Walking along the beach, we picked up tar on our feet. When we lay down on the beach, wind blew sand into our ears. Off in the distance, apartment buildings of pink concrete were slowly being assembled, and there were signs that in a month vacationers from somewhere would fill the bleak plazas, the boarded-up arcades. But for now there was only the whipping wind, a useless sun, and&#x2014;singly, idly, silently in the middle distance&#x2014;Arabs. Or were they Berbers? Dark men, at any rate, in robes, who frightened our baby, Genevieve. Fantastic as it seems now, when she is so tall and lovely in her spangled disco dress, she was then overweight and eight. Caleb was ten, Mark twelve, and Judith a budding fourteen.<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Je le regrette beaucoup</i>,&#x201d; I told the manager of the Restinga hotel, a blue-sweatered young man who wandered about closing doors that had blown open, &#x201c;<i>mais il faut que nous partirons. Trop de vent, et pas de bain de la mer.&#x201d;</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Trop de vent,</i>&#x201d; he agreed, laughing, as if reassured that we were not as crazy as we had seemed.<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Les enfants sont malheureux, aussi ma femme. Je regrette beaucoup de partir. L&#x2019;h�tel, c&#x2019;est beau, en �t�.</i>&#x201d; I should have used the subjunctive or the future tense, and stopped trying to explain.<br><br>The manager gave our departure his stoical blessing but explained, in cascades of financial French, why he could not refund the money we had prepaid in London. So I was left with a little cash, a Hertz credit card, four children, a wife, and plane tickets that bound us to ten more days in Morocco.<br><br>We took a bus to Tangier. We stood beside an empty road at noon, six stray Americans, chunky and vulnerable in our woolly English clothes with our suitcases full of continental sun togs bought at Lilywhite&#x2019;s and of Penguins for vacation reading. The sun beat upon us, and the wind. The road dissolved at either end in a pink shimmer. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe this,&#x201d; my wife said. &#x201c;I could cry.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t panic the kids,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;What else can we do?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;There are no taxis. We have no money.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There must be <i>some</i>thing,&#x201d; she said. Somehow, my mem- ory of the moment has dressed her in a highly unflattering navy-blue beret.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m scared,&#x201d; Genevieve announced, clutching her knapsack and looking painfully hot and rosy in her heavy gray overcoat.<br><br>&#x201c;Baby,&#x201d; sneered her big sister, who attracted stares from native men everywhere and was feeling a certain power.<br><br>&#x201c;The bus will come,&#x201d; Daddy promised, looking over their heads to the vanishing point where the road merged in the pink confusion of the new buildings the king was very slowly erecting.<br><br>A thin dark man in a dirty caftan materialized and spoke to us in a lengthy nasal language. He held out his palms as if to have them read.<br><br>&#x201c;Dad, the man is talking to you,&#x201d; Mark, then prepubescent and now a graduate student in computer science, said, very embarrassed.<br><br>&#x201c;I know he is,&#x201d; I told him, helplessly.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s he saying, Dad?&#x201d; Genevieve asked.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s asking if this is the bus stop,&#x201d; I lied.<br><br>The man, continuing to speak, came closer, confiding a breath rich in Muslim essences&#x2014;native spices, tooth decay, pious fasting with its parched membranes. His remarks grew more rapid and urgent, but a light was dying in his bloodshot eyes.<br><br>&#x201c;Tell him to go away.&#x201d; This suggestion came from Caleb, our silent, stoic, sensible child, now a college junior majoring in zoology.<br><br>&#x201c;I think he will,&#x201d; I hazarded, and the man did, shaking his skeletal head at our unresponsive idiocy. Our little family clustered closer in relief. Sand blew into our shoes, and the semicircular halls of the abandoned hotel, our only home in this foreign land, howled at our backs like some deep-voiced, clumsy musical instrument.<br><br>The bus! The bus to Tangier! We waved&#x2014;how we waved!&#x2014;and with an incredulous toot the bus stopped. It was the green of tired grass, and chickens in slatted coops were tied to the top, along with rolled-up rugs. Inside, there were Moroccans: dusty hunched patient unknown people, wearing knit little things on their heads and knit little things on their feet, their bodies mixed in with their bundles, the women wrapped in black, some with veils, all eyes glittering upward in alarmed amazement at this onrush of large, flushed, childish Americans.<br><br>The fare, a few dirhams, was taken noncommittally by a driver, who had a Nasseresque mustache and a jaw to match. There was room at the back of the bus. As we wrestled our ponderous suitcases down the aisle, the bus swayed, and I feared we might crush with our bulky innocence this frag- ile vehicle and its delicately balanced freight. Deeper into the bus, an indigenous smell, as of burned rope, intensified.<br><br>In Tangier, the swaying bus was exchanged for a single overloaded taxi, whose driver in his desire to unload us came into the Hertz office and tried to help the negotiations along. Allah be praised, his help was not needed: the yellow plastic Hertz card that I produced did it all. Had I been able to produce also the pale green of an American Express card, our suspenseful career down the coast, from Tangier to Rabat to Casablanca and then through the narrower streets of El Jadida and Essaouira and Tafraout, would have been greatly eased, for at each hotel it was necessary to beg the clerk to accept a personal check on a London bank, and none but the most expensive hotels would risk it; hence the odd intervals of luxury that punctuated our penurious flight from the Mediterranean winds.<br><br>The avenues of Rabat as we drove into the city were festooned in red. Any thought that we were being welcomed with red banners gave way when we saw hammers and sickles and posters of Lenin. A Soviet high-level delegation, which included Kosygin and Podgorny, was being received by the versatile king, we discovered at the Rabat Hilton, which was booked so solid with Communists that it could not shelter even the most needy children of free enterprise.<br><br>But a hotel less in demand by the Soviets took us in, and at dinner, starved, we were sat down in a ring on piled carpets, around what in memory seems an immense brass tray, while a laughing barefoot girl tiptoed at our backs, sprinkling rosewater into our hair. Mark, tickled, made his monkey face.<br><br>This sensation of being beautifully served amid undercurrents of amusement recurred in a meadow high above the sea, where, after miles of empty landscape and empty stomachs, a minuscule restaurant, scarcely more than a lean-to, advertised itself with a wooden arrow. We stopped the rented Renault and with trepidation walked across the grass, single-file, feeling again huge, as when we trod deeper into that fragrant bus. We halted when a man emerged from the shack bearing a table, and a boy emerged carrying chairs. With an air of amusement all around, this furniture was set on the grassy earth, in a spot we lightly indicated. From the shed were produced in time wine, rice, kebabs, and Cokes, which we consumed in sight of the Atlantic, of beige cliffs, and of vast pastures grazed by a single donkey&#x2014;the only customers, for all we knew, that this beautiful restaurant by the sea had ever had.<br><br>Even on the rough back road to Tafraout, into the stony hills of the Low Atlas, with the gas gauge saying zero and not a house, not a sheep or goat, in sight, a little girl in a dip of the unpaved track held out a handful of flowers. The road here had become one with the rocks of a dry riverbed, so our Renault was moving slowly, so slowly she had time, when she saw we were truly not going to stop, to whip our fenders with the flowers and to throw them at the open car window. One or two fell inside, onto our laps. The rest fell onto the asphalt beside her feet. In the rearview mirror I saw the little girl stamp her foot in rage. Perhaps she cried. She was about the age of Genevieve, who expressed empathy and sadness as the girl diminished behind us and dropped from sight.</p><h2>A Plague of Secrets: A Novel (Dismas Hardy, Book 13)</h2><p>The best-selling author of Betrayal puts Dismas Hardy back on the case as Maya Townshend, the beautiful San Francisco socialite and niece to the mayor, becomes embroiled in conspiracy, cover-ups, and tabloid-fueled controversy after the murder of two acquaintances. 250,000 first printing.</p><p><strong> Amazon Exclusive: Steve Berry Reviews A Plague of Secrets </strong> <br> <p> <b> Steve Berry is the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of international suspense thrillers, <em>The Venetian Betrayal</em>, <em>The Alexandria Link</em>, <em>The Amber Room</em>, <em>The Templar Legacy</em>, <em>The Romanov Prophecy</em> and <em>The Third Secret</em>. His latest novel is <em>The Charlemagne Pursuit</em>. </b><br><br> John Lescroart is a master at building worlds. Over the course of his many novels, he&#x2019;s created a supple, elegant theater of San Francisco, populating it with an entourage of fascinating people. <br><br> At the top of that list is former-policeman, now defense lawyer, Dismas Hardy. Next is Hardy&#x2019;s close friend, Abe Glitsky, of the San Francisco Police Department. A few books back in the series (The Hunt Club) we met Wyatt Hunt, a local private detective. <br><br> A Plague of Secrets brings these three personalities together again when Dylan Vogler, the manager of a coffee shop in San Francisco&#x2019;s Haight-Ashbury district, is found dead cradling a knapsack full of marijuana. When Hardy learns that Vogler is actually supplying dope to many of San Francisco&#x2019;s business and political elite, the tension and turmoil ratchet up into high-stakes suspense. Add in a murder charge that Hardy is called upon to defend, and Lescroart&#x2019;s feisty, devil-may-care hero is once again thrust into the epicenter of a raging legal hurricane. The book&#x2019;s title says it all. There is indeed a plague of secrets, one in particular that Hardy becomes legally bound to protect. <br><br> Through tight prose, surgical plotting, and relentless pacing, Lescroart offers more of his unadorned reality, expertly exploring the seamier side of law, politics, ethics, and morality. <br><br> A Plague of Secrets is lush and lusty, fascinating and smart, told in a wry, appealing voice. I&#x2019;m often asked if I will ever write a legal thriller. Maybe. Who knows? But if I ever do I hope it&#x2019;s half as good as one of John Lescroart&#x2019;s. He&#x2019;s in the top echelon of thriller masters. I&#x2019;ve been a fan for a long time (don&#x2019;t tell him, okay?). Guilt is one of my all time favorite books. A Plague of Secrets is a prize to be savored&#x2014;another of John Lescroart&#x2019;s beguiling and entertaining romps. <br><br></p><b>John Lescroart</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of nineteen previous novels, including <i>Betrayal, The Suspect, The Hunt Club</i>, and <i>The Motive</i>.</p><h2>The Medical I Ching: Oracle of the Healer Within</h2><p>This book is a special version of the timeless Chinese classic of philosophy and metaphysics written especially with the health care practitioner in mind.

Sifu Tsuei Wei has said, "If the Nei Jing is the door to the treasure house of Chinese medical classics, then the I Ching is its key." </p><p>Now, with the publication of Dr. Miki Shima's The Medical I Ching: Oracle of the Healer Within, perhaps the most clinically useful part of the medical I Ching literature is being introduced to the West.</p>Miki Shima is a 48-year-old Japanese practitioner of acupuncture, moxibustion, herbal medicine and the medical I Ching and I live in Corte Madera, California, USA.

But on the first day of his senior year, Greg Gaines thinks he&#39;s figured it out. The answer to the basic existential question: How is it possible to exist in a place that sucks so bad? His strategy: remain at the periphery at all times. Keep an insanely low profile. Make mediocre films with the one person who is even sort of his friend, Earl. This plan works for exactly eight hours. Then Greg&#39;s mom forces him to become friends with a girl who has cancer. This brings about the destruction of Greg&#39;s entire life.</p><p><p>Jesse Andrews is a writer, musician, and former German youth hostel receptionist. He is a graduate of Schenley High School and Harvard University and lives in Brooklyn, New York, which is almost as good as Pittsburgh. This is his first novel. Visit him online at www.jesseandrews.com.</p>A frequently hysterical confessional from a teen narrator who won't be able to convince readers he's as unlikable as he wants them to believe.<br><br>"I have no idea how to write this stupid book," narrator Greg begins. Without answering the obvious question&#x2014;just <em>why</em> is he writing" this stupid book"?&#x2014;Greg lets readers in on plenty else. His filmmaking ambitions. His unlikely friendship with the unfortunately short, chain-smoking, foulmouthed, African-American Earl of the title. And his unlikelier friendship with Rachel, the titular "dying girl." Punctuating his aggressively self-hating account with film scripts and digressions, he chronicles his senior year, in which his mother guilt-trips him into hanging out with Rachel, who has acute myelogenous leukemia. Almost professionally socially awkward, Greg navigates his unwanted relationship with Rachel by showing her the films he's made with Earl, an oeuvre begun in fifth grade with their remake of <em>Aguirre, Wrath of God</em>. Greg's uber-snarky narration is self-conscious in the extreme, resulting in lines like, "This entire paragraph is a moron." Debut novelist Andrews succeeds brilliantly in painting a portrait of a kid whose responses to emotional duress are entirely believable and sympathetic, however fiercely he professes his essential crappiness as a human being.<br><br>Though this novel begs inevitable thematic comparisons to John Green's <em>The Fault in Our Stars</em> (2011), it stands on its own in inventiveness, humor and heart.</p><h2>Monsters on a Plane (Billy and the Mini Monsters 4)</h2><p>It&#x2019;s vacation time for Billy and his Mini Monsters.

Well, we've got something even better: Memoria Press' new <i>Classical Composition</i> program, written by James Selby, doesn't just incorporate the classical approach, it is the classical approach. Going back to the method of writing instruction used for over 2,000 years, <i>Classical Composition</i> teaches the student 14 composition skills, called the progymnasmata, a set of elementary rhetorical exercises that formed the basis of persuasive writing. This approach was used to teach writing by Quintilian and Cicero, and produced writers such as Milton, Shakespeare, and Benjamin Franklin. <br> This books comes after the Fable and Narrative Stages. &#x201c;Chreia&#x201d; (pronounced cray-a) and &#x201c;Maxim&#x201d; both mean &#x201c;a wise saying&#x201d;. Students will not be learning how to invent their own witty one-liners, but they will learn how to compose a short essay that explains and applies such a saying so that a reader can understand its meaning and consent to follow its wisdom. As the student learns the theory, he will practice inventing good explanatory paragraphs. (The Chreia and Maxim exercises are similar to an expository essay in modern composition theory.)</p><p></p><h2>Bear Grylls Survival Camp</h2><p>Let Bear Grylls teach you everything you need to know to cope in all weather and terrain and even through the air, over the seas, and under the waves.

G. Wells, A Short History of the World (1922)<br> THE WRONG SIDE OF GLOBALIZATION<p></p> <br>It&#x2019;s 3:00 a.m., and I&#x2019;m mopping up whisky-smelling puke after a country music concert in Charleston, West Virginia.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s the summer of 1991, just after my freshman year of college. While most of my friends from Northwestern University are off doing fancy internships at law firms, congressional offices, and investment banks in New York or Washington, I am one of six guys on the after-concert janitorial crew at the Charleston Civic Center, which seats 13,000 people.<br> <br>Working the midnight shift is worse than jet lag. You have to decide if you want your work to be the beginning of your day or the end of your day. I would wake up at 10:00 p.m., eat &#x201c;breakfast,&#x201d; work from midnight to 8:00 a.m., and then go to bed around 3:00 p.m.<br> <br>The other five guys on the crew were a tough bunch. They were good guys but beaten down. One carried a pint bottle of vodka in his back pocket, which was done by &#x201c;lunch&#x201d; at 3:00 a.m. A scraggly redhead from the hollows, the valleys that run between West Virginia&#x2019;s hills, was sort of near my age. The others were in their 40s and 50s, at what should have been the peak of their wage-earning potential.<br> <br>The way country music concerts work in West Virginia is people drink way too much. Our job was to clean up the result. The six of us canvassed the arena with enormous jugs of fluorescent-blue chemicals, which, when poured on the concrete floor, would just sizzle.<br> <br>The last wave of innovation and globalization produced winners and losers. One group of winners were the investors, entrepreneurs, and high-skilled laborers that congregated around fast-growing markets and new inventions. Another class of winners were the more than 1 billion people who moved from poverty into the middle class in developing countries because their relatively low-cost labor was an advantage once their countries opened up and became part of a global economy. The losers were people who lived in high-cost labor markets like the United States and Europe whose skills could not keep up with the pace of technological change and globalizing markets. The guys I mopped with on the midnight shift were the losers in large part because the job they could have gotten in a coal mine years before had been replaced by a machine, and whatever job they could have gotten in a factory from the 1940s to the 1980s had moved to Mexico or India. For these men, being a midnight janitor was just not the summer job it was to me; it was one of the only options left.<br> <br>Growing up, I thought that life in West Virginia was representative of life everywhere. You were doing your best to manage a slow descent. But the phenomenon I was witnessing in West Virginia really made sense to me only as I traveled the world and saw other regions rising as West Virginia was falling.<br> <br>Twenty years after pushing a mop on the midnight shift, I&#x2019;ve now seen the world and been exposed to the highest levels of leadership in the biggest technology companies and governments around the world. I&#x2019;ve served as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton&#x2019;s senior advisor for innovation, a position she created for me just as she became known as Madame Secretary. Before going to work for Clinton, I served as the convener for technology and media policy on the Obama campaign that beat her in the 2008 presidential primary and had spent eight years helping run a successful, technology-based social venture that I cofounded. My job at the State Department was to modernize the practice of diplomacy and bring new tools and approaches to addressing foreign policy challenges. Clinton recruited me to bring a little innovation mojo to the tradition-bound State Department. We had a lot of success, and at the time that she and I left in 2013, we were ranked as having the most innovation-friendly culture of any cabinet-level department in the federal government. We developed successful programs to address nasty challenges in places as varied as the Congo, Haiti, and the cartel-controlled border towns in northern Mexico. In the background of all this was the role I played building a bridge between America&#x2019;s innovators and America&#x2019;s diplomatic agenda.<br> <br>In this time, I spent much of my life on the road. I saw a lot of the world before and after my time in government, but the 1,435 days I spent working for Hillary Clinton gave me a particularly intense, close-up view of the forces shaping the world. I traveled to dozens and dozens of countries, logging more than half a million miles, the equivalent of a round trip to the moon with a side trip to Australia.<br> <br>I saw next-generation robotics in South Korea, banking tools being developed in parts of Africa where there were no banks, laser technology used to increase agricultural yields in New Zealand, and university students in Ukraine turning sign language into the spoken word.<br> <br>I have had the chance to see many of the technologies that await us in the coming years, but I still often think back to that stint as a midnight janitor and the men I met there. The time I spent gaining a global perspective on the forces shaping our world helped me understand exactly why life had grown so rough in my home in the hills and why life was getting so much better for most of the rest of the world.<br> <br>The world in which I grew up, the old industrial economy, was radically transformed by the last wave of innovation. The story is by now well worn: technology, automation, globalization.<br> <br>While I was in college in the early 1990s, the process of globalization accelerated further, bringing to an end many of the political and economic systems that defined yesterday&#x2019;s economies. The Soviet Union and its satellite states failed. India began a series of economic reforms to liberalize its economy, eventually bringing more than a billion people onto the global economic playing field. China reversed its economic model, creating a new form of hybrid capitalism and pulling more than half a billion people out of poverty.<br> <br>The European Union was created. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) came into effect, integrating the United States, Canada, and Mexico into what is now the world&#x2019;s largest free trade zone. Apartheid ended and Nelson Mandela was elected president of South Africa.<br> <br>While I was in college, the world was also newly coming online. The World Wide Web was launched to the public, along with the web browser, the search engine, and e-commerce. Amazon was incorporated while I was driving to a training site for my first job out of college.<br> <br>At the time, these political and technological shifts did not seem as important to me as they do now, but the changes that took place while I was growing up in West Virginia and that accelerated with the rise of the Internet have made the lives we lived even just 20 years ago seem like distant history.<br> <br>Those people in my hometown with worse job security than their parents are still living a better life when you measure it up against what their money can buy today that it could not decades ago, including more and better communications and entertainment, healthier food, and safer cars and medical advances that keep them alive longer. Yet they&#x2019;ve been through a raft of changes, both positive and negative. And all this change will pale in comparison to what is going to come in the next wave of innovation as it hits all 196 countries on the planet.<br> <br>The coming era of globalization will unleash a wave of technological, economic, and sociological change as consequential as the changes that shook my hometown in the 20th century and the changes brought on by the Internet and digitization as I was leaving college 20 years ago.<br> <br>In business areas as far afield as life sciences, finance, warfare, and agriculture, if you can imagine an advance, somebody is already working on how to develop and commercialize it.<br> <br>The places where innovation gets commercialized are expanding too. In the United States, breakthroughs are coming not only from Silicon Valley, from the Route 128 corridor around Boston, or from North Carolina&#x2019;s research triangle. They are beginning to come out of Utah, Minnesota, and the Washington, D.C., suburbs in Virginia and Maryland. The breakthroughs will not be exclusively American, either.<br> <br>After years of growth rooted in low-cost labor, there are promising signs of innovation coming from the 3 billion people who live in Indonesia, Brazil, India, and China. Latin American countries with a face to the Pacific, including Chile, Peru, Colombia, and Mexico, appear to have figured out how to position themselves in the global economy. The highest-skilled labor markets in Europe are producing start-ups that make Silicon Valley green with envy, and in tiny Estonia, &#x201c;the little country that could,&#x201d; the entire economy seems to be an e-economy.<br> <br>Innovation is likewise transforming Africa, where even in the refugee camps of the Congo, technologies as simple as the cell phone are connecting people to information and each other as never before. Africa&#x2019;s entrepreneurs are now changing the face of the continent, fueling development and creating a new class of globally competitive businesses.<br> <br>Everywhere, newly empowered citizens and networks of citizens are challenging the established order in ways never before imaginable&#x2014;from building new business models to challenging old autocracies.<br> <br>The near future will see robot suits that allow paraplegics to walk, designer drugs that melt away certain forms of cancer, and computer code being used as both an international currency and a weapon to destroy physical infrastructure halfway around the world.<br> <br>This book examines these breakthroughs, but it is not simply a hosanna to the benefits of innovation. Advances and wealth creation will not accrue evenly. Many people will gain. Some people will gain hugely. But many will also be displaced. Unlike the previous wave of digital-led globalization and innovation, which drew enormous numbers of people out of poverty in low-cost labor markets, the next wave will challenge middle classes across the globe, threatening to return many to poverty. The previous wave saw entire countries and societies lifted up economically. The next wave will take frontier economies and bring them into the economic mainstream while challenging the middle classes in the most developed economies.<br> <br>Across large swaths of the globe, people feel newly under siege by rising inequality and unwelcome disruption. A pervasive sense that it is becoming harder to find your place in the world or get ahead is rattling many societies.<br> <br>Innovation brings both promise and peril. The same forces that are unleashing unparalleled advances in wealth and welfare may also allow a hacker to steal your identity or hack your home. A computer that can speed up analysis of legal documents can also shrink the number of lawyers in the workforce. Social networks can open doors to form new connections or create new forms of social anxiety. The digitization of payments can facilitate commerce or allow for new forms of fraud.<br> <br>When I was a college student at the dawn of the Internet revolution, I did not have the slightest inkling of the future that lay ahead. I wish I had been able to read a book back then that took a good stab at what was next. Certainly no one is omniscient, but I have been fortunate enough to gain a glimpse of what lies around the next corner.<br> <br>This book is about the next economy. It is written for everyone who wants to know how the next wave of innovation and globalization will affect our countries, our societies, and ourselves.<br> GROWING UP IN THE OLD ECONOMY<p></p> <br>To understand where globalization is going in the future, you have to understand where it&#x2019;s coming from. I grew up in Charleston, West Virginia, a city whose history reflects America&#x2019;s centuries-long rise as an economic powerhouse from the grime-covered mines that helped fuel its growth. West Virginia was built on coal, much the same way that Pittsburgh was built on steel and Detroit was built on cars. Indeed, it was West Virginia&#x2019;s connections through coal to the industrial North that led it to secede from Virginia and the more agricultural South when the American Civil War broke out.<br> <br>West Virginia&#x2019;s position mirrored that of other mining centers connected to the Industrial Revolution&#x2019;s first manufacturing bases. In the United Kingdom, Midlands cities like Manchester and Leeds became the industrial base. London provided the finance. Coal came from Wales. In Germany, the Ruhr region near the Rhine River valley became a manufacturing center. Coal came from eastern Germany and Poland.<br> <br>Today coastal China, particularly the areas around Shenzhen and Shanghai, has become the world&#x2019;s factory. Its coal comes from western China and Australia. Similarly, mining regions in India&#x2019;s northeastern peninsular belt, Turkey&#x2019;s Anatolia region, and Brazil&#x2019;s Santa Catarina region supply the industrial bases of their emerging economies and other economies around the world. In each region, mining offers a stepping-stone toward greater economic ties and opportunities&#x2014;at least for a time.<br> <br>Building on its coal boom, West Virginia developed complementary industries that cemented its position as an industrial supply center and eventually presaged its decline. In the early 20th century, Charleston underwent its second boom: chemicals. The Union Carbide Corporation established the world&#x2019;s first petrochemical plant in West Virginia in 1920.<br> <br>With America&#x2019;s entry into World War II, massive amounts of synthetic rubber were needed to meet wartime demands. Union Carbide, which became the largest employer in West Virginia and one of the top ten chemical companies in the world, launched a period of growth that continued well after the war. Between 1946 and 1982, its revenues increased from about $415 million to more than $10 billion. During that time, it employed as many as 80,000 people globally, roughly 12,000 of them in West Virginia. And as the company continued to grow, so did Charleston. By 1960, its population had grown to 86,000 from 68,000 before the war.<br> <br>When I was in school, a big percentage of my classmates were children of chemical company engineers. Their families were often the most worldly, arriving from top universities around the country and the globe. And for over a century, the old-economy industrial fields of West Virginia&#x2014;coal, chemicals, and plastics&#x2014;were stable, reliable career choices.<br> <br>My family came to West Virginia when my grandfather, Ray DePaulo, moved from the coal camps of Colorado during the Great Depression. His high school had closed down due to lack of funds, so they just handed out diplomas to everyone, including my then 13-year-old grandfather. Luckily for him, that was still a time when you could make a living with just a high school diploma.<br> <br>Once in West Virginia, my grandfather became what we&#x2019;d now glowingly call an entrepreneur. He went door-to-door selling telephones at a time when people were getting phones in their homes for the first time. He ran a garage, a golf course, a restaurant, a bakery, a parking lot, and a house-cleaning business, much of it out of a stall used by car salesmen.<br> <br>My grandfather understood one of the curious conundrums of globalization: exposure creates not only opportunity but competition, and it can make us question and eventually lose our standing in the world.

Tap has come home and he is talking of the western lands."&nbsp;<br><br>So I gathered my rope to a coil and slung it on the pommel of my saddle, and stepping up to the leather, I followed Pa up through the trees and out on the open grass.<br><br>Folks were standing in the breezeway of our Texas house, and others were grouped around in bunches, listening to Tap Henry or talking among themselves.&nbsp;<br><br>It was not a new thing, for there had been argument and discussion going on for weeks. We all knew that something must be done, and westward the land was empty.<br><br>Tap Henry was a tall man of twenty-seven or -eight and we had been boys together, although he was a good six to seven years older than me. A hard, reckless man with a taste for wild country and wilder living, he was a top hand in any man's outfit, and a good man with a gun.&nbsp;<br><br>You couldn't miss Tap Henry. He was well over six feet tall and weighed a compact one hundred and ninety. He wore a freshly laundered blue shield-style shirt with a row of buttons down each side, shotgun chaps, and Spanish boots with big California spurs.<br><br>He still packed that pearl-handled six-shooter he had taken off a man he had killed, and he was handsome as ever in that hard, flashy way of his. He was our friend and, in a sense, he was my brother.<br><br>&nbsp;Our eyes met across the heads of the others as I rode up, and his were cold and measuring. It was a look I had seen in his eyes before, but never directed at me. It was the way he looked when he saw a possible antagonist. Recognition came suddenly to his eyes.<br><br>"Danny! Dan, boy!" He strode through the crowd that had gathered to hear his talk of the lands to the west, and thrust out a hand. "Well, I'll be forever damned! You've grown up!"&nbsp;<br><br>Stepping down from the saddle, I met his grip with one of my own, remembering how Tap prided himself on his strength. For a moment I matched him, grip for grip, then let him have the better of it, for he was a proud man and I liked him, and I had nothing to prove.<br><br>It surprised me that we stood eye to eye, for he had always seemed very tall, and I believe it surprised him too.<br><br>Almost involuntarily, his eyes dropped to my belt, but I was wearing no gun. My rifle was in my saddle-boot and my knife was in its sheath.<br><br>"We're going west, Danny!" His hand on my shoulder, we walked back to where Pa now stood with Aaron Stark and Tim Foley. "I've scouted the land, and there is grass enough, and more!"<br><br>Pa glanced curiously from one to the other of us, and from the shadow of the breezeway Zebony Lambert watched us, a strange light in his green eyes. Zeb's long brown hair lay about his shoulders, as carefully combed as a woman's, his eyes level and hard under the flat brim of his Spanish hat.<br><br>&nbsp;Zebony Lambert was my friend, but I do not think he had many friends, for he was a solitary, self-keeping sort of man little given to talk. Of medium height, his extraordinarily broad shoulders made him seem shorter, and they were well set off by the short Spanish jacket he wore, and the buck-skin, bell-bottomed breeches.<br><br>Lambert and Tap had never met until now, and it worried me a little, for both were strong men, and Tap was inclined toward arrogance.<br><br>"Is it true, then?" I asked Pa. "Is it decided?"<br><br>"Aye . . . we're going west, Dan."<br><br>Tim Foley was our neighbor who ran a few cows of his own, but occasionally worked for us. A square-built man with a square, honest face. "And high time," he said, "for there is little grass and we have those about us who like us not at all."<br><br>"How far is it, then?"&nbsp;<br><br>"Six hundred miles or less. Right across Texas and into New Mexico. If we do not go on, it will be less."<br><br>Pa looked at me. More and more he was paying mind to my judgment, and listening to what I had to say. He was still the boss . . . I knew that and he knew it, but he had respect for my judgment, which had grown since he had been leaving the cattle business to me.<br><br>"How many head, Dan? What can we muster?" Pa put the question and I caught a surprised look from Tap, for he remembered me as a boy, and a boy only.<br><br>"Fifteen hundred at least, and I'd say a bit more than that. Tim will have a good three hundred head under his own brand, and Aaron nearly as many. When all are rounded up and the breaks swept clean, I would say close to three thousand head."&nbsp;<br><br>"It is a big herd, and we will be short of men," Pa commented thoughtfully.<br><br>"There will be three wagons, and the horse herd," I added.<br><br>"Wagons?" Tap objected. "I hadn't planned on wagons."<br><br>"We have our families," Tim said, "and there are tools we must take."<br><br>There began a discussion of what to take, of trail problems and men, and I leaned against the corral rail, listening without paying much attention. In every such venture there is always more talk than is necessary, with everybody having his say, but I knew that when all was said, much of it would be left to me, and I would do as seemed best to me.<br><br>There is no point in such endless discussion, except that men become familiar with their problems. Long ago, when the first discussion of such a move began, I had also begun thinking of it, and had made some plans I thought necessary. Lambert, a thoughtful man, had contributed a few pointed and common-sense suggestions.<br><br>&nbsp;We could muster barely a dozen men, far too few for the task that lay ahead. Once the herd was trail-broke, four to five men might keep it moving without much trouble, but until then it would be a fight. Some of these old mossyhorns had grown up there on the Cowhouse and they had no wish to leave home.<br><br>There would be the usual human problems too, even though the people who would be accompanying our move would all be known to us. And once away from the settlements, there would be Comanches.<br><br>&nbsp;It was a risk, a big risk. We were chancing everything.<br><br>&nbsp;We might have fought it out where we were, but Pa was no hand for a fight, although he had courage enough for two men, and had seen his share of fighting in the Mexican War and with Indians. He had grown up in the Five Counties and knew what feuding meant. It was Tap who had suggested going west, and Pa fell in with it.<br><br>But there was risk connected with everything, and we were hard men bred to a hard life in a hard land, and the lives that we lived were lonely, yet rich with the voice of our singing, and with tales told of an evening by the campfire.&nbsp;<br><br>What pleasures we had were created by ourselves or born of the land, our clothing was made by our own hands, our houses and corrals, also. Those who rode beside us knew the measure of our strength as we knew theirs, and each knew the courage of the other.<br><br>In that country a man saddled his own broncs and fought his own battles, and the measure of his manhood was that he did what needed to be done, and did it well, and without shirking.<br><br>Me? I, Dan Killoe, was born in a claim cabin on Cowhouse Creek with the roar of buffalo guns filling the room as Pa and my Uncle Fred beat off an Indian attack. I let out my first yell in a room filled with gunsmoke, and when Ma died I was nursed by a Mexican woman whose father died fighting with the Texans at the Alamo.<br><br>When I was six, Pa met Tap's Ma on a trip to Fort Worth, and married her, bringing her west to live with us, and they brought Tap along.<br><br>She was a pretty woman, as I recall, and good enough to us boys, but she wasn't cut out for frontier life, and finally she cut and run with some no-account drifter, leaving Tap to live with us.<br><br>Tap always pulled his weight, and more. He took to cow country like he was born to it, and we got along. He was thirteen and doing a man's work and proud of it, for the difference between a man and a boy is the willingness to do a man's work and take a man's responsibility.<br><br>Being older than me, he was always the leader, no matter what we were doing, and a few times when we had a chance to attend school, he took up for me when I might have taken a beating from bigger boys.<br><br>&nbsp;When Tap pulled out the first time he was seventeen and I was a bit more than ten. He was gone most of a year, working for some outfit over in the Big Thicket.<br><br>The next time I saw him he was wearing a pistol, and we heard rumors he had killed a man over near Caddo Lake.<br><br>When he was at home he worked like all get-out, but he soon had the name of being a good man to let alone. Pa said nothing much to him, only dropping a comment now and then, and Tap always listened, or seemed to. But he was gone most of the time after that, and each time he came back he was bigger, tougher, and more sure of himself.&nbsp;<br><br>It had been three years since we had last seen Tap, but now he was back, and at the right time, too. Trouble was building along the Cowhouse and neighbors were crowding in, and it was time we moved west and laid claim to land.<br><br>We would be leaving mighty little on the Cowhouse. When Pa moved into the country a body couldn't live there at all without neighbors and they bunched up for protection. Some died and some were killed, some drifted and some sold out, but the country changed and the people, and now it was building into a fight for range.<br><br>Some of the newcomers had no cattle, and from time to time they would kill a beef of ours. Pa was no one to keep a man's youngsters from food, so he allowed it. The trouble was, they turned from killing a beef for food to driving them off and selling them, and trouble was cropping up.<br><br>A couple of times I'd caught men with our brand on some steers they were driving, and I drove them back, but twice shots had been fired at me.<br><br>The old crop that worked hard and fought hard for their homes were gone. This new lot seemed to figure they could live off what we had worked for, and it was developing into trouble. What we wanted was land that belonged to us--land with boundaries and lines drawn plain and clear; but due to the way everybody had started out on the Cowhouse, that wasn't true here.<br><br>There was talk of moving west, and then Tap rode in, fresh from that country.<br><br>Pa was a farmer at heart, more interested in crops than cattle, and of late I'd taken to running the cattle business.<br><br>"It is a bad trip, I'll not lie about that," Tap was saying. "But the time of year is right, and if we start soon there will be grass and water."<br><br>"And when we get there?" Foley asked.&nbsp;<br><br>"The best grass you ever saw, and water too. We can stop on the Pecos in New Mexico, or we can go on to Colorado."<br><br>"What would you suggest?" Foley was a shrewd man, and he was keeping a close watch on Tap as he questioned him.<br><br>"The Pecos country. Near Bosque Redondo."<br><br>Karen Foley came to stand beside me, her eyes watching Tap. "Isn't he exciting?" she said. "I'm glad he will be with us."<br>&nbsp;<br>For the first time I felt a twinge of jealousy, but it was a small twinge, for I liked and admired Tap Henry myself, and I knew what she meant.<br><br>Tap was different. He had come riding back into our lives wearing better clothes than we could afford, riding a fine chestnut gelding with a beautifully hand-tooled saddle, the first one I had ever seen. Moreover, he carried himself with a kind of style.<br><br>He had a hard, sure way about him and he walked and moved with an assurance we did not have. You felt there was no uncertainty about Tap Henry, that he knew what he wanted and knew how to get it. Only faintly, and with a twinge of guilt, did I think that perhaps he cared too little for the feelings or interests of others. Nevertheless, I could think of no better man on a trip of the kind we were planning.<br><br>&nbsp;Karen was another thing, for Karen and I had been walking out together, talking a little, and a couple of times we had taken rides together. We had no understanding or anything like it, but she was the prettiest girl anywhere around, and for a girl out on the Texas plains she got herself up mighty well.<br><br>She was the oldest of Tim Foley's three children. The other two were boys, fourteen and ten.<br><br>&nbsp;It was plain she was taken by Tap Henry, and one thing I knew about Tap was that he was no man to take lightly where women were concerned. He had a way with them, and they took to him.<br><br>Pa turned around. "Come over here, Dan. We want your advice."<br><br>Tap laughed as I walked up, and clapped a hand on my shoulder in that way he had. "What's the matter, Killoe? You taking advice from kids now?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Dan knows more about cattle than anybody I ever knew," Pa said quietly, "and this won't be his first trail drive."<br>&nbsp;<br>"You?" Tap was surprised. "A trail drive?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Uh-huh. I took a herd through Baxter Springs last year. Took them through to Illinois and sold them."<br><br>"Baxter Springs?" Tap chuckled. "Lost half your herd, I'll bet. I know that crowd around Baxter Springs."<br>&nbsp;<br>"They didn't cut Dan's herd," Foley said, "and they didn't turn him aside. Dan took them on through and sold out for a good price."</p><h2>We Have Always Lived in the Castle</h2><p>Dust jacket notes: &#34;With her own special witchery, Shirley Jackson has once again fashioned a strange, terrible, and beautiful tale. From the very first page, a mystery hangs over the three people living in the big old house on the hill. Shunned by the villagers, they live their private life behind closed doors. As their story quietly and deftly unfolds, the reader is led into a situation both startling and macabre. The drama of its denouement, with its unforeseen aftermath, has the quality of a horror tale disguised in the most deceptive innocence. But telling the &#39;story&#39; of a book by Shirley Jackson is as meaningless as trying to describe in words what is conveyed to the eye by a surrealist painter. For it is not just the subject about which she chooses to write, or even her ability as an immensely gifted storyteller, that distinguishes her work; it is her unique vision, illuminating the familiar.&#34;</p><p>Visitors call seldom at Blackwood House. Taking tea at the scene of a multiple poisoning, with a suspected murderess as one's host, is a perilous business. For a start, the talk tends to turn to arsenic. "It happened in this very room, and we still have our dinner in here every night," explains Uncle Julian, continually rehearsing the details of the fatal family meal. "My sister made these this morning," says Merricat, politely proffering a plate of rum cakes, fresh from the poisoner's kitchen. <i>We Have Always Lived in the Castle</i>, Shirley Jackson's 1962 novel, is full of a macabre and sinister humor, and Merricat herself, its amiable narrator, is one of the great unhinged heroines of literature. "What place would be better for us than this?" she asks, of the neat, secluded realm she shares with her uncle and with her beloved older sister, Constance. "Who wants us, outside? The world is full of terrible people." Merricat has developed an idiosyncratic system of rules and protective magic, burying talismanic objects beneath the family estate, nailing them to trees, ritually revisiting them. She has made "a powerful taut web which never loosened, but held fast to guard us" against the distrust and hostility of neighboring villagers.<p> Or so she believes. But at last the magic fails. A stranger arrives--cousin Charles, with his eye on the Blackwood fortune. He disturbs the sisters' careful habits, installing himself at the head of the family table, unearthing Merricat's treasures, talking privately to Constance about "normal lives" and "boy friends." Unable to drive him away by either polite or occult means, Merricat adopts more desperate methods. The result is crisis and tragedy, the revelation of a terrible secret, the convergence of the villagers upon the house, and a spectacular unleashing of collective spite.</p><p> The sisters are propelled further into seclusion and solipsism, abandoning "time and the orderly pattern of our old days" in favor of an ever-narrowing circuit of ritual and shadow. They have themselves become talismans, to be alternately demonized and propitiated, darkly, with gifts. Jackson's novel emerges less as a study in eccentricity and more--like some of her other fictions--as a powerful critique of the anxious, ruthless processes involved in the maintenance of normality itself. "Poor strangers," says Merricat contentedly at last, studying trespassers from the darkness behind the barricaded Blackwood windows. "They have so much to be afraid of." <i>--Sarah Waters</i></p>SHIRLEY JACKSON (1919-1965), a celebrated writer of horror, wrote such classic novels as <i>The Haunting of Hill House</i> and <i>We Have Always Lived in the Castle</i>, as well as one of the most famous short stories in the English language, ''The Lottery.''

Is it because something is wrong with the church? Perhaps that&#39;s part of the picture. But Philip Yancey insists there is another part. In this candid, thought-provoking account, he reveals the reasons behind his own journey back from skepticism to wholehearted participation in the church, and weighs the church&#39;s human failings against its compelling excellencies as the body of Christ.</p><p>Philip Yancey asks the question that haunts many believers: Why should I bother with the church? From growing up in rural Georgia in a fundamentalist church to his experience at LaSalle Street Church in inner city Chicago, Philip reflects on the church, his own perceptions of it, and the various metaphors the Bible uses to describe it. Yancey&#39;s own early church experience set his faith back by many years. In Church: Why Bother? he offers us a glimpse of his pilgrimage back to faith and to the church as a place of real community and spiritual vitality. This honest and insightful book will help you explore your questions about the place of the church in the life of faith and how to find spiritual connection and community.Philip Yancey serves as editor at Large for Christianity Today magazine. His books The Jesus I Never Knew and What&#39;s So Amazing About Grace? were national best-sellers appearing on both the Publisher&#39;s Weekly and ECPA lists. Both books also won the Gold Medallion Book of the Year Award. Yancey has written eight Gold Medallion Award-winning books, including Where Is God When it Hurts? Disappointment with God, and The Gift of Pain. He co-edited The Student Bible, which also won a Gold Medallion Award.

He is a Brooklyn native with degrees in accounting from Pace University and in journalism from Ball State University. He is the author of <i>The Jordan Rules </i>and <i>Second Coming. </i>He lives in Illinois with his family.<b>Chapter One: Spring 1990</b><br>Michael Jordan surveyed his crew and got that sinking feeling.<br>It was just before 11:00 A.M. on May 24, 1990, two days after the Bulls had fallen behind the Detroit Pistons two games to none in the Eastern Conference finals. The city of was awash in spring -- all two hours of it, as the old-time residents like to say -- but Jordan wasn't feeling very sunny. He didn't even feel like playing golf, which friends would say meant he was near death.<br>The Bulls had gathered for practice at the Deerfield Multiplex, a tony health club about thirty-five miles north of Chicago, to try to get themselves back into the series. Jordan's back hurt, as did his hip, shoulder, wrist, and thigh, thanks to a two-on-one body slam in Game 1 courtesy of Dennis Rodman and John Salley. But his back didn't hurt nearly as much as his pride or his competitiveness, for the Bulls were being soundly whipped by the Pistons, and Jordan was growing desperately angry and frustrated.<br>"I looked over and saw Horace [Grant] and Scottie [Pippen] screwing around, joking and messing up," Jordan told an acquaintance later. "They've got the talent, but they don't take it seriously. And the rookies were together, as usual. They've got no idea what it's all about. The white guys [John Paxson and Ed Nealy], they work hard, but they don't have the talent. And the rest of them? Who knows what to expect? They're not good for much of anything."<br>It was a burden Michael Jordan felt he had to bear. The weight of the entire team was on his tired shoulders.<br>The Pistons had taken the first two games by 86-77 and 102-93, and Detroit's defense had put the Bulls' fast break in neutral: The Bulls had failed to shoot better than 41 percent in either game. Jordan himself had averaged only 27 points, stubbornly going 17 for 43. No team defensed Jordan better than the Pistons, yet he refused to admit that they gave him a hard time, so he played into their hands by attacking the basket right where their collapsing defensive schemes were expecting him. The coaches would look on in exasperation as Jordan drove toward the basket -- "the citadel," assistant coach John Bach liked to call it -- like a lone infantryman attacking a fortified bunker. Too often there was no escape.<br>Although Detroit's so-called Jordan rules of defense were effective, the Bulls coaches also believed the Pistons had succeeded in pulling a great psychological scam on the referees. It had been a two-part plan. The first step was a series of selectively edited tapes, sent to the league a few years earlier, which purported to show bad fouls being called on defenders despite little contact with Jordan. The Pistons said they weren't even being allowed to defense him. "Ever since then, the foul calls started decreasing," Jordan noted, "and not only those against Detroit."<br>Step two was the public campaign. The Pistons advertised their "Jordan rules" as some secret defense that only they could deploy to stop Jordan. These secrets were merely a series of funneling defenses that channeled Jordan toward the crowded middle, but Detroit players and coaches talked about them as if they had been devised by the Pentagon. "You hear about them often enough -- and the referees bear it, too -- and you start to think they have something different," said Bach. "It has an effect and suddenly people think they aren't fouling Michael even when they are."<br>It only added to Jordan's frustration with Detroit.<br>At halftime of Game 2, with the Bulls trailing 53-38, Jordan walked into the quiet locker room, kicked over a chair, and yelled, "We're playing like a bunch of pussies!" Afterward, he refused to speak to reporters, boarded the bus, and sat in stony silence all the way home. He continued his silence -- other than a few sharp postgame statements -- for the next week. He would not comment on his teammates. "I'll let them stand up and take responsibility for themselves," he told a friend.<br>Jordan had really believed that the Bulls could defeat Detroit this time. Of course, there was no evidence to suggest it could happen, since the Pistons had knocked the Bulls out of the playoffs the previous two seasons and had taken fourteen of the last seventeen regular-season games between them. But hadn't there been similar odds in 1989 when the Bulls had faced Cleveland in the playoffs? The Cavaliers had won fifty-seven games that season to the Bulls' forty-seven, and they were 6-0 against the Bulls, even winning the last game of the regular season despite resting their starters while the Bulls played theirs. The Bulls' chances were as bleak as Chicago in February.<br>Jordan promised that the Bulls would win the Cleveland series anyway.<br>Playing point guard, Jordan averaged 39.8 points, 8.2 assists, and 5.8 rebounds in the five games. And with time expiring in Game 5, he hit a hanging jumper to give the Bulls a 1-point victory. The moment became known in Chicago sports history as "the shot," ranking with Jordan's other "shot" in the 1982 NCAA tournament, a twenty-foot jumper that gave North Carolina a last-second victory over Georgetown. It also sent the Cavaliers plummeting; over the next two seasons, they would not defeat the Bulls once.<br>The playoffs had become Jordan's stage. He was Bob Hope and Michael Jackson, Mick Jagger and Frank Sinatra. His play transcended the game. It was a sweet melody received with a grand ovation. Others jumped as high and almost everyone slammed the ball, but Jordan did it with a style and a smile and a flash and a wink, and he did it best in the postseason.<br>"There's always been the feeling on this team," Bach had said after that Cavaliers series, "that if we got to the Finals, Michael would figure out some way to win it. He's the greatest competitor I've ever seen and then he goes to still another level in the big games."<br>It was true: Jordan's playoff performances had been Shakespearean sonnets, beautiful and timeless. And like Shakespeare, he was the best even though everyone said so. In just his second season in the league, after missing sixty-four games with a broken foot, Jordan demanded to return to the court despite warnings by doctors that he might exacerbate the injury to his foot. The Bulls, and even Jordan's advisers, said he should sit out the rest of the season. Jordan angrily accused the team of not wanting to make the playoffs so it could get a better draft pick. He was reluctantly allowed to return with only fifteen games remaining in the regular schedule. The Bulls made the playoffs, and in Game 2 against the Boston Celtics (who would go on to win the NBA title) Jordan scored 63 points. Larry Bird put it this way: "It must be God disguised as Michael Jordan."<br>In the 1988 playoffs against the Cavaliers, Jordan opened the series with 50- and 55-point games, the first time anyone had ever scored back-to-back 50s in the playoffs, to lead the team to victory and establish an all-time five-game-playoff-series scoring record of 45.2 points per game. Jordan had become perhaps the greatest scorer in the game's history. He would never equal Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game or his hundred-plus 50-point games, but by the end of 1990-91 season, Jordan had become the all-time NBA scoring average leader in the regular season, the playoffs, and the All-Star game. And he'd won his fifth straight scoring title, putting him behind only Chamberlain's seven.<br>And now, facing the Pistons in 1990, he was coming off a series against the 76ers in the second round of the playoffs that was unbelievable even by his own amazing standards. The Bulls won in five games as Jordan averaged 43 points, 7.4 assists, and 6.6 rebounds. He shot nearly 55 percent in 42.5 minutes per game. He drove and he dunked. He posted up and buried jumpers. He blocked shots and defended everyone from Charles Barkley to Johnny Dawkins.<br>"I never played four consecutive games like I did against Philly," he said of the first four, in which he led the team in scoring in thirteen of sixteen quarters.<br>And then the Bulls, storming and snorting, headed for Detroit to take on the Pistons. The two teams hailed from hard-edged, blue-collar towns, Chicago with its broad shoulders and meat-packing history, Detroit with its recession-prone auto industry. For some reason, though, Detroit's sports teams seemed to have a perpetual edge over Chicago's. In 1984 the Cubs finally won a piece of a baseball tide, but it was the Detroit Tigers who won the World Series, just as they had in 1945, the year of the Cubs' last World Series appearance. Many times Gordie Howe's Detroit Red Wings had come into the Stadium and ruined the dreams of Bobby Hull's Black Hawks. And now there were the Pistons. Detroit had made a habit of beating Chicago. It was a habit Michael Jordan was determined to break.<br>But no matter how hard he tried against the Pistons, he couldn't beat these guys. In earlier seasons, Jordan had some of his biggest scoring games against the Pistons: a 61-point mosaic in an overtime win in March 1987, an Easter Sunday mural on national TV in 1988 in which he'd scored 59 points. And Jordan <i>was</i> an artist, the ninety-four-by-fifty-foot basketball court being the canvas for his originals, signed with a flashing smile, a hanging tongue, and a powerful, twisting slam. Pistons coach Chuck Daly, a man who appreciated the arts, was not particularly enamored of Jordan's work, and after the 1988 game the Pistons instituted "the Jordan rules" and the campaign to allow what the Bulls believed was legalized assault on Michael Jordan.<br>The Pistons had two of the league's best man-to-man defenders, Joe Dumars and Dennis Rodman, to carry out those assignments. Jordan grudgingly respected Dumars, with whom he'd become somewhat friendly at the 1990 All-Star game; Dumars was quiet and resolute, a gentlemanly professional. But Jordan didn't care much for Rodman's play. "He's a flopper," Jordan would say disdainfully. "He just falls down and tries to get the calls. That's not good defense." Rodman once "flopped" so effectively back in the 1988-89 season that Jordan drew six fouls in the fourth quarter to foul out in the last minute of a close loss to the Pistons.<br>But Jordan's frustration against the Pistons was much larger than his dislike for Rodman, his team's lack of success against Detroit, or even his failure to score effectively since that Easter Sunday game. Detroit simply beat up Jordan, battering him through picks and screens whenever he tried to move. For Jordan, it was like trying to navigate a minefield of bullies. First he'd take a forearm shiver from Dumars when he tried to get past, then perhaps a bump from Bill Laimbeer and a bang from Rodman or Isiah Thomas. The Bulls were so concerned about some of these tactics a few years ago that they focused a camera on Laimbeer throughout the playoffs to see what he was doing and found that he was grabbing players at their pressure points to deaden their arms. They complained to the league but got no action. And while Thomas is not considered a good defender because he doesn't like to play a helping game, whenever the Bulls play Detroit he is quick to double-team Jordan. He knows Jordan despises him and doesn't care much for Jordan being the hero in Chicago, Isiah's hometown.<br>Jordan's resentment toward the angelic-looking Thomas is deep. Much of it stems from an alleged freeze-out of Jordan in the 1985 All-Star game, when Thomas and other players apparently conspired to keep Jordan from getting the ball -- and their paths have continued to cross along with their swords. During the 1989-90 season, Johnson suggested a one-on-one match between himself Jordan. Jordan wasn't too interested, but Johnson was looking at a big pay-per-view payoff and had already worked out a deal with a cable TV company. When word surfaced though, the NBA voiced its disapproval, and Thomas, head of the Players' Association, said it was not in the best interests of the players to have such unsanctioned off-season games. Suddenly Jordan was very interested. He said he always thought the Players' Association "was supposed to be for the players." And anyway, Jordan said, Thomas was just jealous. "He wasn't asked," snarled Jordan. "And do you want to know why? It's because if he were in it no one would be interested enough to watch."<br>But the Pistons get their shots back at Jordan. They love to taunt Jordan during games about his selfish play, his baldness (that's a specialty of John Salley), and how he enjoys being a loser. Salley, a bad stand-up comic who has earned a stage because he is seven feet tall and looks like Arsenio Hall, is a particularly bitter antagonist.<br>"There's not one guy who sets the tone on our team," Salley liked to tell reporters during the 1990 playoffs. "That's what makes us a team. If one guy did everything, we wouldn't be a team. We'd be the Chicago Bulls."<br>And this, too, from Salley: "We don't care who scores the points as long as we win. It would be hard for Michael Jordan to play on this team because he's got to score all the points. I don't think he'd fit in here."<br>Jordan burned over comments like that, but he seemed helpless to pay back the Pistons. Jordan was perhaps the league's best when angered, dunking over seven-footers after they'd blocked his shot, scoring wildly against boastful rookies, and surging to great heights when opponents scored on him regularly or tried to show him up, But Jordan couldn't make it happen against the Pistons, and his teammates were unable to ease the burden he felt.<br>In Game 1, John Paxson and Craig Hodges missed all 8 of their field-goal attempts and Scottie Pippen was thwarted by Rodman. "I seem to spend too much time worrying about how he's going to play me," Pippen would say later. Among Detroit starters, only Joe Dumars would score in double 27 points, but it would be enough.<br>In Game 2, Jordan limped on his injured hip and leg, and the Bulls fell. Pippen and Horace Grant scored 17 each, but it was hardly enough to make up for the ailing Jordan, who scored only 20. Dumars scored 31.<br>And so Jordan left the game without speaking to anyone, leaving the media scrambling for reasons and teammates searching for answers. It was not a happy group that headed back to Chicago for Game 3. Jordan believed his team had let him down when he was hurt. The team believed he'd let them down by failing to face the media after such a critical loss. Sure, several noted, he was there long into the night after he scored 50 points, but where was he when he scored only 20? And his man, Dumars, burned him in two straight games, and had clearly been the difference in Detroit's taking a 2-0 lead. The players agreed: We hear it from him when we don't play well, but when <i>he</i> doesn't play well it's still our fault?<br>Center Dave Corzine, a former Bull, had once explained it well: "It's hard playing on a team with Michael because you're always the reason the team lost." It certainly couldn't be Jordan's fault, everyone usually agreed; he was the best, wasn't he? There was not much anyone on the team could say publicly.<br>But Jordan would be ready for Game 3 back in the Stadium. He was angry and chastened, a little contrite perhaps, but also demanding payment for assorted sins.<br><br>Phil Jackson did the talking for the next few days following Tuesday's Game 2. Jordan, usually playful during practice, wasn't saying much. After practice Wednesday, with the media waiting and watching, most of the players skipped out the back door directly to the parking lot, which is what they always did when they wanted to avoid the press. But after complaints from the media, Jackson told Jordan he would have to go out the front door on Thursday -- to run the gauntlet, as the coaches liked to say, although the demands on Jordan from the local media (and the national media, too, for that matte...</p><h2>The Oracle Book: Answers to Life&#39;s Questions</h2><p>The popular astrologer for InStyle draws on the principles and practices of the ancient art of bibliomancy--fortelling the future using books--to help readers make various types of life decisions, presenting more than 250 short phrases to which readers can randomly flip to answer a variety of yes-or-no questions. 125,000 first printing.</p><p>Like the reading of Tarot cards, the spreading of the runes, or the touch of a Ouija board, <i>The Oracle Book</i> offers immediate responses to seekers' questions. Written by <i>In Style</i> magazine's savvy astrologer Georgia Routsis Savas, this immediate form of divination is called bibliomancy--the art of foretelling the future using books. The idea is for readers to first ask a yes-or-no question (the clearer the question, the clearer the response). Then readers run their thumbs over the edge of the pages of the <i>Oracle Book</i> until they sense their thumb has landed on the right spot. Finally, they open the page. The answer appears in a two-page spread and could come from any number of divination sources, including Tarot, astrology, dice, and even tea leaves. For example, it might read, "Libra, the sign of the scales, or balance, counsels you to consider another's feelings. Or, "The Crystal ball depicts an empty purse; don't be greedy." Or, "The tea leaves are in the shape of a shell: whatever you desire will be yours." The attractive typeface and illustrations make this an enticing tool to work with. As with all oracles, it's the reader's open-mindedness and intuitive skills that will determine how lasting and helpful of a resource this can be. <i>--Gail Hudson</i>Georgia Routsis Savas has written for a variety of magazines including the NY Daily News, and writes a monthly column for InStyle magazine.

Dispels many of the myths surrounding the famous battle of the three emperors. Brought to life with numerous eyewitness accounts. A Main Selection for the History Book Club. The Battle of Austerlitz is almost universally regarded as the most impressive of Napoleon&#39;s many victories. The magnitude of the French achievement against a significantly larger army was unprecedented. In this insightful new study the author analyses the planning of the opposing forces and details the course of the battle hour by hour, describing the fierce see-saw battle around Sokolnitz, the epic struggle for the Pratzen Heights, the dramatic engagement between the legendary Lannes and Bagration in the north, and the widely misunderstood clash of Napoleon&#39;s Imperial Guard and Alexander&#39;s Imperial Leib-Guard. The author has produced a detailed and balanced assessment of the battle that for the first time places familiar French accounts in their proper perspective and exposes many myths regarding the battle that have been perpetuated and even embellished in recent books. With 1805: Austerlitz, the reader is left with a new appreciation of Napoleon and his Grande Army of 1805, an army that decisively defeated not a hapless relic of the ancien regime but rather a formidable professional army that had fought the French armies on equal terms five years earlier. Robert Goetz has been studying the Russian Army of the Napoleonic Wars for the past seven years, an area of specialization that emerged from his longstanding interest in the French Revolution and Napoleonic era. He is the author of several award-winning articles concerning the Russian Army and its campaigns.</p><p>Robert Goetz was awarded the esteemed 2005 History Grand Prize of the Fondation Napol�on on December 6, 2005 for his book <i>1805: Austerlitz; Napoleon and the Destruction of the Third Coalition</i> (Greenhill Books, 2005). Awarded annually in Paris by the Fondation Napol�on, the Grands Prix are presented to the best works of Napoleonic literature. Gathering the award for the best non-French language book, Goetz&#x2019;s <i>1805: Austerlitz</i> specifically highlights the Battle of Austerlitz &#x2013; a battle almost universally regarded as the most impressive of Napoleon&#x2019;s many victories. <p>The Fondation Napol�on was founded in 1987 to promote interest and research on topics surrounding the Napoleonic era, both encouraging and supporting many different projects all with the same primary aims, namely, a deeper understanding of the period and the preservation and highlighting of the Napoleonic heritage.

She lives in Harlemville, New York.*Starred Review* As they did in the beautiful Brother Sun, Sister Moon (2011), Newbery medalist Paterson and cut-paper artist extraordinaire Dalton combine their considerable talents to bring to young people the concept of giving thanks. Paterson offers several meditations on ways she experienced thanksgiving, gratitude, and love throughout her life. Following each are several pages of poems, hymns, and snippets of praise songs from various cultures and religions, allowing readers to experience emotions and practices through many voices. Dalton, who is a practitioner of the early-nineteenth-century American paper-cutting technique called scherenschnitte (&#x201c;scissor cuts&#x201d;), has used paper &#x201c;antiqued in a coffee solution, ironed, and illuminated with watercolor.&#x201d; She fashions wondrous garlands, lattices hiding birds and rabbits, individual flowers and butterflies, and frames housing families reading books. The considerable thought to design&#x2014;from substantial buff-colored pages to the placement of the art&#x2014;is balanced by an equal appreciation for the works selected. Wonderful to have on hand for Thanksgiving, this is a book to be picked up throughout the year and savored and discussed.

But before you can say Goldfinger, Alex spots his old nemesis, renowned assassin Yassen Gregorovich, on the beach. What Alex discovers is a plan so diabolical that it makes all of his previous adventures seem like a stroll in the Queen Mum&#x2019;s garden. Alex must fight to keep Gregorovich from executing the plans of a mysterious and murderous madman--an operation code named "Eagle Strike."

Readers will find humor in what mooses do when they go for walks and will be surprised by the silly adventures mooses partake in. Look out -- you never know when a moose may be watching you! <p>Awards and honors for <i>Mooses Come Walking</i>:<br>Child Magazine, "1995 Picture Book Award"</p></p><p>Arlo Guthrie has produced more than a dozen albums -- and for the first time, one of his songs has been illustrated to create this charming children&#39;s book. He lives in Massachusetts.<p>--<i>KIRKUS REVIEWS,</i> September, 1995<br> Guthrie's first book is an endearing poem that is supposed to be about moose, but whose blithe rhymes have nonsense verse written all over them, "Mooses come walking up over the hill./Mooses come walking, they rarely stand still." Only 12 lines long, the story is delivered a half-line at a time, complemented by acrylic paintings that have the simplicity of woodcuts in their bold black lines and even blocks of subdued color. The moose gather and peer into a window, where they see a terrified person in bed. Then they leave. There may be simple truths hidden between the lines, but even if there aren't, this is as finger-snapping catchy as Mother Goose with antlers. <br> </p><p>--<i>PUBLISHERS WEEKLY,</i> October 23, 1995<br> Folksinger/songwriter Guthrie teams with Brock (the Alice of "Alice's Restaurant" fame) in this raffish book about moose who "come walking up over hills" to peek into bedroon windows. Once there, "The mooses are smiling / they think it's a zoo / and that's why the mooses / like looking at YOU." The poem, which Guthrie recites at his concerts, is filled with a subtle yet sly humor, adroitly captured by Brock's <i>(How to Massage Your Cat)</i> stylized illustrations. Deceptively simple, expertly composed paintings place her moose between the somewhat spooky and down-right silly; and her strong but limited palette (she sometimes uses as few as three colors on a page) effectively complements the minimalism of Guthrie's good-humored language. Ages 2-6. <br> </p><p>-- <i>THE NEW YORK TIMES,</i> Alice Miller Bregman, December 1995 I grew up in New York City, where I learned to negotiate the streets with caution but without fear. On the other hand, I was terrified of, everything in the country--grass, trees, silence and, especially, wild animals. In my imagination, wild animals hid behind every shrub waiting to jump out at me. This made sleeping in the country very difficult, because I had to be ever vigilant in case one of them left its hiding place to look for me. If I had only had Arlo Guthrie's comforting <i>Mooses Come Walking</i> to refer to, all my worries would have vanished.<br><br> In Mr. Guthrie's poem, "Mooses come walking up over the hill.... / When mooses come walking they walk where they will ! Mooses look into your window at night.... / The mooses are smiling, they think it's a zoo / and that's why the mooses like looking at you." And how could I have remained frightened of wild animals when they only want to have a look at me, and with the same curiosity and fondness that I had when I looked at the animals in the Central Park Zoo?<br><br> If you are an Arlo Guthrie fan, as I am, you will be able to hear his dry, nasal twang reciting these lines, as in fact he does now at some point in all his concerts. Indeed, this book grew out of requests about where to find the poem in print. Here he teams up with Alice M. Brock, his friend from that famous restaurant of yore, whose illustrations have provided the perfect visual accompaniment for his voice.<br><br> Ms. Brock uses flat, autumnal colors and simple shapes to create some friendly moose who amble over some plain fading-green hills till they find a house and a window to look in. Then, just as amiably, they amble back over those hills, leaving readers feeling cozy and safe and masterful.<br><br> Lately it seems that lots of celebrities--rock musicians and others--have turned their attention to children's books, with greater or lesser success. Arlo Guthrie's talent is more appropriate to the genre than most. Performing his own music for years has helped him to find the perfect cadence for his verse, and because he has learned when to stop, he never loses his audience. This makes for very little text; but though this is a small book, it produces a big response--which is the case with well-thought-out books.<br><br> <i>Mooses Come Walking</i> is a perfect bedtime story for city and country kids alike and will keep them (and me) sleeping contentedly under the covers instead of worrying about what may be roaming around behind the trees outside. Thanks, Arlo and Alice. Good night. <br> </p><p>--<i>CHILD MAGAZINE,</i> December/January 1996 Every child deserves a little silly time, and that's where <i>Mooses Come Walking</i> fits in. A quirky collaboration by folksinger Guthrie and artist Brock, this nonsensical nighttime tale of moose plodding over the hill to peek in people's windows is a hoot.<br> </p><p>--<i>BOOKLIST,</i> December 15, 1995<br> Folksinger Guthrie adds children's literature to his long list of accomplishments with this humorous picture book based on his offbeat poem of the same name. The plot is simple: a group of friendly moose come out of the hills at night and peek into a boy's bedroom window, smiling because they "think it's a zoo." Guthrie closes by suggesting, "It's best just to lay there pretending you're dead (advice that may cause some controversy). The mooses will leave and you'll get the thrill of seeing the mooses go over the hill." The childlike simplicity of the text is complemented by Brock's primitive-style cartoon illustrations, which achieve dimension by the use of plain, overlapping colored shapes outlined in black. This is too short to be a central element in a storytime, but it will be a delightful little extra in a session featuring animals or poetry.<br> <br></p></p><h2>First Sight: A Novel</h2><p><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES</i> BESTSELLER</b><br><br>Paris, L.A., and the world of ready to wear fashion provide rich backdrops for Danielle Steel&#x2019;s deeply involving story of a gifted designer whose talent and drive have brought her everything&#x2014;except the ability to erase her past and trust relationships.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>FIRST SIGHT </b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> New York. London. Milan. Paris. Fashion Week in all four cities. A month of endless interviews, parties, and unflagging work and attention to detail at the semiannual ready to wear fashion shows&#x2014;the famous pr�t-�-porter. At the center of the storm and avalanche of work is American Timmie O&#x2019;Neill, whose renowned line, Timmie O, is the embodiment of casual chic, in fashion and for the home. She has created a business that inspires, fills, and consumes her life. <br> &nbsp;<br> With an unerring instinct for what the next trend will be, an innate genius for business, tireless labor, and sheer fearlessness, starting from nothing, over two decades Timmie has built an international empire that has brought her enormous satisfaction and success. In a world where humility and compassion are all too rare, her humor, kindness, integrity, and creativity are inspirational. Yet as blessed as she feels by her success, Timmie harbors the private wounds of a devastating childhood and past tragedy. She is too smart, too experienced, and too hurt to want much in her personal life beyond a succession of convenient, very limited relationships. Always willing to take risks in business, she never risks her heart.<br> &nbsp;<br> But despite her well-ordered and highly controlled world, it turns out that Timmie O&#x2019;Neill is not immune to magic when it strikes. And it strikes in Paris during Paris Fashion Week, when an intriguing Frenchman comes into her life when she gets sick. At first, Timmie and Jean-Charles Vernier are only patient and physician. They become confidants and friends, corresponding at a safe distance between Paris and Los Angeles once she goes home. There is every reason why they must remain apart. But neither can deny their growing friendship and the electricity that sparks whenever they meet. <br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>First Sight</i> is as complex and compelling as modern life itself. Careers, families, histories, losses, duty, obligation, and fear of losing control and getting hurt. It is a tale of daring to take risks, and losing control just enough to have a life, when the opportunity presents itself. When two very different worlds and strong-willed people collide, everything changes in an instant, as they confront the age-old question of whether to lay oneself bare and risk intimacy&#x2014;or not. Are they brave enough to face what comes next? And will they do it together or apart?<br><br><b>Praise for <i>First Sight</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;A novel about love, in all its heartbreaking and splendid forms.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;Steel is one of the world&#x2019;s most popular authors, and this poignant romance is sure to thrill her many loyal fans and reach many new readers, too.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Booklist</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;Steel deftly stages heartstring-tugging moments.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></b></p><p><b>Danielle Steel</b> has been hailed as one of the world&#x2019;s most popular authors, with over 600 million copies of her novels sold.

She was exhausted after a week in New York, then two more in Europe, first in London, then in Milan. It was a pilgrimage she made twice a year in February and October for the ready to wear fashion shows, the famous "pret-a-porter." She was the founder, guiding light, principal designer, and CEO of the most important men's and women's ready to wear lines in the United States, with subsidiary companies in Europe, which was what brought her to the European ready to wear shows twice a year. She showed her U.S. lines with the other American designers in New York during the first week, and then showed her French subsidiary lines in Paris. And in between, she attended the London and Milan runway shows. And she went to Men's Fashion Week in Paris as well, for her men's lines.<br><br>Timmie O'Neill had run her business single-handedly for twenty-three years, since she was twenty-five years old, when it all began. At forty-eight, her empire was so vast, it encompassed children's wear, home furnishings, and decorating accessories, including wallpaper, sheets, towels, and linens. Ten years before, they had added cosmetics, men and women's skin care products, and half a dozen perfumes, which had stunned them all with their universal appeal and almost instant success in every country where they were sold. Timmie O'Neill was a name that was known worldwide, and associated with style, fashion at a range of price points, and astonishing success.<br><br>The world of Timmie O had been a legendary victory for more than two decades, and now its founder and CEO was heading for Paris to oversee the October ready to wear show of its European-based lines. The rest of the American designers wore themselves out during the frenzy of fashion week in New York, without adding the insanity of the European pret-a-porter. Only Timmie did both, with her boundless energy and success. But even she was exhausted after Milan, and absolutely drained when she thought of doing the show in Paris. The clothes they had shown in New York had been received with even greater than usual kudos from the press.<br><br>For her entire career, it seemed, Timmie O'Neill had had a Midas touch, and could do no wrong in the eyes of the fashion world. Even during the occasional seasons when she had been less pleased with their lines herself, or the critics had been slightly less in love with them, they had done staggeringly well nonetheless. Everything Timmie did, she did well. She threw herself into all she undertook with perfectionism and inimitable style and grace. She was relentless in how hard she pushed herself, far more than anyone else, and what she expected of herself. She had an uncanny knack for predicting what the world would want to wear, live with, and smell like, long before they thought about it themselves. Along with their clothing lines, their perfumes were among the biggest sellers in the world. She had chosen the scents and designed the packaging herself. There was very little that Timmie O'Neill didn't do well, brilliantly, in fact, except maybe cook. And dress, she liked to say. As sensitive and forward thinking as her designs were, she insisted that most of the time she didn't care what she wore herself. She had little time to give it much thought, although the clothes she designed had made her famous, particularly her signature sportswear, which managed to be simultaneously casual, easy to wear, and chic. There was a simple, clean elegance to everything she designed, and without even trying, or thinking about it, she herself was the epitome of casual chic.<br><br>On the flight from Milan, she was wearing jeans, a T-shirt, both of her own label, a vintage mink jacket she had found years before in the backstreets of Milan, and black ballerina flats she had designed the year before. She carried a large black alligator Hermes bag that had been the precursor of the Birkin, and was even more striking because of its size, and had real style because it looked well worn, after years of use on trips such as this.<br><br>The pilot announced their descent toward Charles de Gaulle Airport in Roissy, just outside Paris, as Timmie stretched her legs out in front of her in one of the plane's eight first-class seats. She had slept for most of the brief flight and through the meal. She was wiped out after the pressure, work, and revels of Milan. She had visited the factories that produced knits, bed and table linens, and shoes for them. The European ready to wear shows particularly entailed endless parties and socializing as well. No one ever slept till the end. There was a priest sitting next to her on the plane, who had said nothing to her during the flight, and was probably one of the few people who wouldn't recognize her, and wasn't wearing something she'd designed. They had nodded to each other politely when she took her seat, and ten minutes later, after glancing at The International Herald Tribune to see what they said about the collection she'd seen in Milan, and London the week before that, she was sound asleep. As the landing gear came down, she glanced out the window with a smile, thinking of Paris, and then turned to her two assistants, who were seated across the aisle from her. The priest had been happy to take the window seat, and neither of Timmie's assistants had disturbed her while she slept. They'd all had a grueling three weeks, first at the shows in New York, then London and Milan. Paris was their last stop, much to their collective relief.<br><br>All four shows were important, and the ready to wear shows in Paris were always high-pressure, fast paced, and stressful from beginning to end. Milan was an important mecca of the fashion world, but victory in Paris was what mattered to her most. It always had. Paris was the city she loved best in the world, and the one that had spawned her dreams. Timmie still looked sleepy as she handed some notes to her assistants, David and Jade. David had been with her for six years, and Jade for twelve. They were passionately devoted to her for her kindness, fairness, and all they'd learned from her personally as well as professionally. Everything about Timmie was inspirational, from the genius of her work, to the thoughtful, compassionate way she treated people. David always said she was lit from within, like a beacon that shined through the darkness, pointing out the path for others. And the best of her was that she was entirely unaware of how remarkable she was. Humility was unheard of in the fashion world, but all who knew her agreed that she was amazingly uncomplicated and modest.<br><br>She had a completely innate, instinctive sense about how to run her business, who she was designing for, and what they wanted to wear next season. She was quick to sense adjustments that had to be made, and never hesitated to make changes in the lines when necessary. There had been many over the years. She was never afraid to try something new, no matter how high risk. She was fearless in all she did. She lived life in bold strokes and had been a wonderful employer and friend to David and Jade over the years. Timmie was trustworthy, incredibly hardworking to the point of being driven, brilliant, creative, funny, compassionate, somewhat obsessive, a perfectionist in all things, and above all kind. The standard she set for competence, efficiency, creativity, and integrity was high.<br><br>David Gold had come to her right after graduating from Parsons as an aspiring designer, and Timmie had rapidly determined that his designs were prosaic and tended to lean more toward past styles that had been reliable and solid, but he had little of the forward vision toward the future that she looked for in design assistants. But she had seen in him something far different and more useful. He had a knack for ingenious marketing ideas, was supremely organized and attentive to details, and had an ability to keep vast numbers of people on track at the same time. She had singled him out of the design team rapidly, and put him to work for her as an assistant. He still came to the shows with her twice a year, but his responsibilities had grown exponentially in his six years with her. At thirty-two, he was a vice president in charge of marketing, and she reviewed all their publicity and ad campaigns with him. Together they had honed their PR image till it gleamed. He was brilliant at what he did.<br><br>As always, he had made everything about the New York and European shows easier for her. Timmie had often said that his business card should read "magician" instead of VP in charge of marketing. The creativity he had lacked as a designer he had a hundredfold when it came to ideas about marketing, advertising, and handling people, in ways Timmie insisted she couldn't have done herself. She was always fair about acknowledging others' achievements and quick to lavish praise where it was due. She was extremely fond of him, and had nursed him back to health herself during a bout of hepatitis four years before. They had been close friends ever since, and he revered her as his mentor, and said she had taught him everything he'd ever learned about the fashion industry, while Timmie claimed he had long since outstripped her skills. Their team efforts were a huge success to the immeasurable benefit of "Timmie O," the company as well as the woman.<br><br>Jade Chin had been an editorial assistant at Vogue, and had come to Timmie's attention at a number of shoots at the magazine, which Timmie often attended herself, to make sure that the clothes were photographed and perceived in the right way. Jade had been just as meticulous as she, just as maniacal about details, and never flinched at an eighteen-hour day. Timmie had hired her after she had been at Vogue for five years, crawling her way up the seemingly endless ladder, which would have eventually landed her a title as editor of some section of the magazine, at pathetically meager pay, with a multitude of perks and little recognition. Instead, Timmie had offered her a salary that had seemed huge to her at the time, and a job as her personal assistant. Despite opportunities to move into the corporate structure of Timmie O over the years, Jade had chosen to remain Timmie's main personal assistant for the past dozen years. She loved her job, and everything it entailed. And she and David were a good team. She and Timmie worked together with exquisite synchronicity, and she had a sixth sense for what Timmie needed, almost before it entered her employer's mind. Timmie had long since said that having Jade as an assistant was every working woman's dream. Jade had almost become the wife Timmie would never have. She thought of every last detail, and even carried Timmie's favorite tea bags in her handbag on every trip. Cups of tea would appear discreetly just when Timmie needed them most, along with lunch, dinner, snacks, exactly the clothes she wanted to change into for an interview, and a detailed accounting of who to call, who had called her, who Jade had successfully fobbed off for her, and a constantly changing sheet of appointments. She kept Timmie moving in the right direction, and always on track, while handling all the minor details for her, and making her life run smoothly at all times.<br><br>The three of them made a remarkable team. Jade and David allowed Timmie to dodge all the irritating details of her daily life, and focus on her work. As she put it, they made her look good, and feel better than she would have otherwise. Jade had been to Paris with her some fifty times in twelve years, and David maybe half as many. Paris was Timmie's favorite city on the planet, and although her U.S. business was based in L.A., she went to Paris every chance she got and traveled all over Europe to keep track of her subsidiary companies there. She had been far braver than most U.S. designers about putting down roots and starting companies in Europe. It had served her well. The trip to Paris never seemed too long to her, and she would go at the slightest provocation, and merest excuse. As she always did after the ready to wear shows in Paris, since they were the last stop in what she referred to as Hell Month, she was planning to stay on for two days alone after the shows to relax. After that, she would join Jade and David in New York, to talk to production people, visit their factory in New Jersey, and meet with their ad agency to discuss a new campaign.<br><br>Timmie was one of the few holdouts who refused to move her base of U.S. operations to New York. She preferred living in Los Angeles, and the life she enjoyed there, dividing her time between her beach house in the Colony in Malibu, and her city house in Bel Air. She had no desire whatsoever to live in a penthouse in New York, freezing in winter, and commuting to the Hamptons in the summer. She liked her life just fine the way it was, and insisted it worked for her. It was hard to argue with success. She hopped on a plane whenever necessary, at the drop of a hat, to go to Paris or New York, or Asia in some cases. David had tried to talk her into buying her own jet, and she insisted that she didn't need one, she was perfectly happy flying on commercial airlines, as she just had to Paris from Milan, and from London before that.<br><br>Considering how successful she was, Timmie was surprisingly unspoiled. She never forgot her simple origins, the luck that had started her on her career, or the coffee shop where she'd worked as a waitress, when she worked on her first designs at night, and bought inexpensive and unusual fabrics with her tips. She had been making clothes for seven years, before her first big break at twenty-five, when a buyer from Barney's noticed some of the clothes Timmie had sold to her co-workers, which were kicky, fun, stylish, and exquisitely made. She bought half a dozen of Timmie's best designs and took them back to the old Barney's store on West 17th Street, long before they moved uptown, and they were an instant hit. Her next order was for twenty-five pieces, then fifty. When the buyer ordered a hundred pieces the following year, Timmie quit the coffee shop, rented a crumbling warehouse in the L.A. fashion district, and hired a dozen girls from an unwed mothers' home to help sew. She had paid them a decent wage, which had been a blessing for them as well as for her. After that, she was on her way. By thirty, she was a nationally known success, and in the eighteen years since, she had skyrocketed into the stratosphere. But she never forgot how and where it all began, or how lucky she had been to be singled out, and blessed with success. Although there had been some tough bumps in her life since, she still felt fortunate in many ways. Most of all in her work.</p><h2>Reclaiming Christianity: A Call to Authentic Faith</h2><p>Does the Church use words that have lost their meaning? Are there Christian words and phrases that have lost their power to convict the human spirit and bring transformation to the world? One of the twentieth century&#39;s most renowned prophetic thinkers, A.W. Tozer, saw a dangerous trend gaining momentum even before his death---a trend that has become commonplace now in the twenty-first century. In this never-before-published book, Tozer sounds his alarm for the modern Church: We must stop parroting words carelessly, and instead allow the meaning that these words convey to empower, shape and direct the work of the Church. Yet Reclaiming Christianity is not just a warning; it is a spiritual guidebook for reconnecting to the deepest meaning of Christianity&#39;s sacred messages.</p><p>"The world usually takes the Church in before the Church takes the world in." A.W. Tozer<br><br> Until the day he died, A.W. Tozer never deviated form exhorting the Church to walk like those who truly belong to the kingdom of God. Although he never softened his censure of what he called "churchianity" built around showmanship, he believed the Church was ripe for reformation, and he longed to see its return to the Holy Spirit-filled, humble, loving fellowship that typified the Early Church.<br><br> If you have ever wondered wht the Church has little influence in the world today, and, equally, how your life could more closely reflect the powerful witness that characterized the early Christians, Tozer's flinty and uncompromising words will remind you of what is missing and challenge you to shun what is superficial so that you can walk toward authentic faith.&nbsp;<br><p><br></p><b>A. W. TOZER</b> embarked upon a lifelong pursuit of God at the age of 17 after hearing a street preacher in Akron, Ohio. He was a self-taught pastor, writer and editor whose powerful messages continue to grip the hearts and stir the souls of today&#x2019;s believers. Follow his quotes at tozeraw@twitter.com.<br> <br> <b>James L. Snyder</b>, general editor, is the pastor of the Family of God Fellowship in Ocala, Florida. He is recognized as an authority on the life and ministry of A.W. Tozer and has written a number of books and essays in Christian periodicals about Tozer.

With his wife, Susanne, he produced the classic <i>Hopi, Navajo,</i> and <i>Field Guide to Southwestern Indian Arts and Crafts</i> and edited <i>Sacred Lands of Indian America.</i> Page lives in New Mexico's Indian Country.This superlative popular history of American Indian peoples distills two generations of scholarship into a rare combination of readability and reliability. For former Smithsonian and Natural History editor Page, who is also a prolific mystery novelist and editor, it is a magnum opus. The early chapters establish, with compelling detail that draws on Indian oral history, that the origins of North America's first inhabitants were varied (including relatives of the Japanese Ainu), and that they were numerous, mostly agricultural, organized as civil societies, and living in mystical harmony neither with nature nor with one another. The book's second half details how European diseases, notably smallpox, arrived before most of the guns or large-scale colonies, with appalling consequences for the cohesion and survival of many tribes. What followed was fighting among tribes (such as the fate of the Pawnee at the hands of mounted rivals like the Sioux), deliberate genocide and sometimes well-intentioned but almost always badly executed government policies that left entire peoples in ruin. There are reprieves from tales of destruction: the Pueblo staged a successful revolt against the Spanish in 1680, while the Iroquois and Cherokee created synthetic cultures that tried to adapt to changing circumstances. The book ends with the discovery of Kennewick Man (Ainu kin), the Red Power movement and the profitable and controversial casino ownership by tribes like the Pequot. A smooth, engaged narrative a useful bibliographic essay, make this a book that fills an enormous gap in the popular historical literature, written with a great feel for the many contexts it addresses. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Empire of the sun</h2><p>"The classic, award-winning novel, made famous by Steven Spielberg's film, tells of a young boy's struggle to survive World War II in China."<p>Jim is separated from his parents in a world at war.

The family eventually put down roots in a ramshackle farmhouse in a small Tuscan village, where she learned how to make ragu and handmade pasta at the elbow of her Italian &#x201c;grandmother&#x201d; on the nearby farm. Meals came from the garden and the surrounding pastures, not the supermarket, and Jenkins grew up schooled in the tradition of cooking from what was on hand.<br> In Olives &amp; Oranges, Jenkins shares the simple, striking dishes she learned at the source. Many, like Peppery Braised Short Ribs and Classic Tuscan Eggplant Parmesan, are favorites from childhood. Others, like Short Pasta with Mushrooms and Mint and Spicy Lemon&#x2013;Chocolate Ganache Tart, have a contemporary sensibility. Jenkins shows how understanding the Mediterranean &#x201c;language of flavor&#x201d; can help you follow your instincts and make your own great meals based on what you have, too. You&#x2019;ll see how salt and lemon juice bring out the natural sugar in Carrot Salad with Lemon, Sea Salt, Parsley, and Olive Oil, and how to use the same technique with lime, salt, and a Moroccan condiment called harissa for a completely different effect in Tunisian Raw Turnip Salad.<br> The opening chapter introduces &#x201c;small plates&#x201d;&#x2014; easy, versatile dishes that can preface a dinner or be grouped together for a small feast, from Roasted Red Peppers with Garlic and Celery Leaves to Chicken Liver Crostini. Soups are spontaneous and flexible, whether they are cooling pur�es like White Almond Gazpacho or sturdy full bowls like Rich Chicken Soup with Greens. The incomparable pastas encompass fast every-night selections (Spaghettini with Burst Cherry Tomatoes) to complex celebration affairs like Braised Rabbit Ragu and Homemade Lasagna.<br> Fish, poultry, and meat chapters feature rustic preparations: roasted scallops capped with a pale green butter seasoned with parsley and garlic; an impressively big-flavored chicken smeared with a mixture of bacon and herbs and baked in a salt crust; and a spectacular staple of Roman trattorias, veal cutlets wrapped in prosciutto and sage and crisp-fried. Desserts range from fresh Strawberries with Prosecco to a sumptuous Coffee Cardamom Crcme Caramel to the rich but light Lemon Olive Oil Cake.<br> Each of the recipes in the book is identified as &#x201c;Quick-Cook&#x201d; or &#x201c;Slow-Cook&#x201d; so you can choose which fit best into your schedule. &#x201c;Flavor Tips&#x201d; throughout the book suggest ways to modify the dishes so you can use what&#x2019;s freshest and most available.<br><br>The daughter of the noted food authority Nancy Harmon Jenkins, SARA JENKINS has earned raves at all the New York restaurants where she has been the chef, including 50 Carmine, Il Buco, I Coppi, and Patio. Her newest venture, Porchetta, is located in New York City&#x2019;s East Village. This is her first book.</p><p>The daughter of noted food authority Nancy Harmon Jenkins, Sara Jenkins has earned raves at all the New York restaurants where she has been the chef, including 50 Carmine, Il Buco, I Coppi, and Patio.<br> &nbsp;While many cooks and cookbooks find inspiration in the Mediterranean's culinary traditions, this appealing, beautifully photographed tome by Jenkins (chef of New York City's Il Buco and Mangia, and the recently opened Porchetta) and Fox (editor of <i>La Cucina Italiana</i>) uniquely synthesizes a diversity of regional styles while adding some fresh ideas to the mix. Having grown up as the daughter of a foreign correspondent and absorbing the culinary vernacular of the countries in which her family resided (Italy, Spain, Cyprus and France), Jenkins uses the Mediterranean pantry as her foundation. She instructs how to select appropriate oils and vinegars; make the most of briny olives, anchovies and bottarga; and select cured meats and cheeses. The recipes that follow are organized almost like a restaurant menu, from a small plate of Sweet Corn Sformato to mains like Slow-Braised Pork Loin with Prunes. Jenkins acknowledges the classics in dishes such as the Tuscan peasant soup Ribollita or the chestnut meringue dessert Montebianco, but she also makes room for her own mashup interpretations, tossing spaghettini with ground lamb, yogurt and mint, and melding jasmine tea and dark chocolate in an intriguing panna cotta. Labeled as slow-cook or quick-cook, recipes are designed for ease without compromising their rich, timeless flavors. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Anyone, from the beginning poet to the mature writer to the lover of literature, will benefit greatly from Hugo's sayd, playful, profound insights and advice concerning the mysteries of literary creation.</p><p>Richard Hugo's <i>The Triggering Town</i>, originally published in 1979, remains one of the freshest and most refreshing treatises on the writing of poetry. While you won't find formality or nicety here, Hugo has the unusual quality of being highly opinionated and yet not at all convinced that what works for him will work for you. Hugo doesn't believe that he can teach you how to write; he believes he can teach you how he writes, and by doing so, teach you "how to teach yourself how to write." And while most writing instructors claim that one can't be a good writer without being a good reader, Hugo claims "that one learns to write only by writing." Hugo's essays are strong-willed and funny and by turns full of bluster and cloaked in modesty. While "a good teacher can save a young poet years by simply telling him things he need not waste time on, like trying to will originality or trying to share an experience in language or trying to remain true to the facts," he writes, "ultimately the most important things a poet will learn about writing are from himself in the process." Above all, Hugo stresses that creative writing is creative because it is a creative act: "if one is writing the way one should, one does not know what will be on the page until it is there." So, he warns, "If you want to communicate, use the telephone." And "Think small.... If you can't think small, try philosophy or social criticism."Richard Hugo was for many years the director of the creative writing program at the University of Montana, Missoula Campus. He received the Theodore Roethke Memorial Prize and was twice nominated for the National Book Award.</p><h2>Relapse Prevention Counseling Workbook: Practical Exercises for Managing High-Risk Situations</h2><p>Relapse Prevention Counseling Workbook.. This workbook presents seven powerful clinical processes that quickly identify and manage the high-risk situations that cause relapse.</p><p></p><h2>Cinderella Story: My Life in Golf</h2><p>One of the funniest, most beloved, and most often quoted entertainers in the world tells his tale of Life and Golf and somehow surviving both--one pilgrim's bemused path through the doglegs.<br><br>With his brilliant creation, groundskeeper Carl Spackler, and the outrageous success of the film <i>Caddyshack</i> firmly etched into the American consciousness, Bill Murray and golf have become synonymous. Now Bill tells the hilarious tale behind the tale.<br><br>The love of the game was with Bill long before Carl uttered the now famous words, "Cinderella story outta nowhere. Former greenskeeper and now about to become the Masters champion." Born and raised in Wilmette, Illinois, Bill felt the lure of the links at a tender age. Following his older brothers Ed and Brian into the rarified world of private country club golf as a caddy, Bill learned life lessons at the caddyshack. "How to smoke, curse, play cards.&nbsp;&nbsp;But more important, when to."<br><br>And long before he caught the acting and writing bug, Bill protected the Evanston Community Golf Course from gophers and golfers as a greenskeeper: "There must be a bent chromosome somewhere in man that urges him to wound that which he cannot conquer--" And throughout his career, the pull of the links has been constant. A summa cum laude graduate of golf school, specializing in the flop shot, Bill's escapades on the Pro-Am golf circuit, at Augusta National, and as a fan at the Masters, the U.S. Open, and the Western Open make for an irresistible read.<br><br>Filled with the kind of deadpan and dead-on hilarity that only Bill Murray could create, <b>Cinderella Story</b> is an up-by-the-bootstraps chronicle of a man, his muse, and his critical examination of our society's fascination with a little white ball.</p><p>To many, Bill Murray is the star of movies like <i>Ghostbusters</i> (reissued with certain scenes deleted and a <i>Mystery Science Theatre</i>-style commentary in 1999). But to golf aficionados, Murray is the clown in godawful "Hee-Haw-aiian" golf garb who plays shamelessly to the crowds at charity tee-offs from Pebble Beach to the Greater Milwaukee Open. And there is only one Bill Murray role, the gopher-snuffing, turf-smoking greenskeeper Carl Spackler in <i>Caddyshack</i>, whose fantasy of golf heroism gives this book its title. "This crowd has gone deadly silent," Spackler mutters with club in hand and no crowd in sight, "a Cinderella story outta nowhere--former greenskeeper and now about to become the Masters champion!"<p> <i>Cinderella Story</i> is really two books. The first is a string of outrageously digressive anecdotes about Murray's club-wielding adventures with Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer ("Incandescent ... he and Patton were born to lead armies"), Mike Ditka, John Denver, Chi Chi Rodriguez ("He had more fun playing golf than any person I'd ever seen."), Clint Eastwood, and Michael Jordan ("Relax," Murray tells himself, "his nickname is 'air,' not 'sand.'"). The prose style is mock-hepcat, insanely allusive, and very smart, like his screen persona.</p><p> This book is also the amusing, affecting autobiography of a kid who started out caddying for 60 cents a half-hour with his brothers--they got busted for giving a blind golfer three hole-in-one trophies--and wound up in showbiz. There are lots of showbiz anecdotes too, especially about <i>Caddyshack</i>, "arguably the greatest film ever made, although perhaps that's a drunken argument," as Murray observes. He'll get no argument from golfers, who will thrill to his expert ridicule of their mutual passion. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>"Murray plays the funny, daffy guy with all the verve he gives to that role in his movies. If he's had a staid moment in his golfing life, it isn't told here."<br>--<i>Washington Post</i><br><br>"No one has ever provided a sport with more comic relief than Bill Murray does golf."<br>--<i>Christian Science Monitor</i><br><br>"A book infused with gentle humor and even poetic insight. The style is breezy, anecdotal and deadpan...like one of Murray's comic routines."<br>--<i>Denver Post</i><br></p><h2>A Christmas Revelation: A Novel</h2><p><b><b>&#x201c;Perry&#x2019;s Victorian-era holiday mysteries [are] an annual treat.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The Wall Street Journal</i></b><br><br>In this intriguing, uplifting holiday mystery from bestselling author Anne Perry, an orphan boy investigates a woman&#x2019;s kidnapping&#x2014;and discovers there&#x2019;s more at stake than a disappearance.</b><br><br> It wouldn&#x2019;t quite be Christmas without a holiday mystery decorated with all the Victorian trimmings, as only <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Anne Perry can render it. Now the tradition continues as mayhem is once again found under the mistletoe, and intrigue stalks the cobblestone streets and gaslit parlors of old London Town.<br><br> Formerly a river urchin living on the banks of the Thames, nine-year-old Worm has never experienced a family Christmas. But thanks to a job at Hester Monk&#x2019;s clinic in Portpool Lane, he&#x2019;s found a makeshift family in kindly volunteer Miss Claudine Burroughs and curmudgeonly old bookkeeper Squeaky Robinson.<br><br> When Worm witnesses the abduction of a beautiful woman by a pair of ruffians just days before Christmas, he frantically turns to Squeaky for help. A one-time brothel owner, Squeaky knows the perils of interfering in nasty business, but he can&#x2019;t bear to disappoint Worm&#x2014;or leave the boy to attempt a rescue on his own. What neither of the would-be saviors expects, however, is that the damsel in distress already has her dilemma well in hand . . . and is taking steps to bring her captors to justice for crimes far worse than kidnapping. But the rogues, as cunning as they are deadly, are not to be underestimated. The aid of cynical old Squeaky and hopeful young Worm just might make the difference between a merry triumph over evil and a terrible yuletide tragedy.</p><p><b>Anne Perry</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of fifteen previous holiday novels, as well as the William Monk series, the Charlotte and Thomas Pitt series, the new Daniel Pitt series, five World War I novels, and a work of historical fiction, <i>The Sheen on the Silk</i>. Anne Perry lives in Los Angeles.Worm stood and stared, overcome with wonder. She was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen, in all his nine years of life. She was like sudden sunshine on a dark day&#x2014;�the place you looked without even thinking about it, all light and warmth and softness. She walked the way everybody should: gently, head up, smiling. Maybe other people looked like her at first glance, but when you looked again you saw she smiled, not as if there were something funny, but as if she knew something good that she could share, if you would stop and listen.<br><br>But no one did. They all walked past her, hurrying on about their business as though they were late, or afraid they might miss something. In the street, there were carts of vegetables for market, a large brewer&#x2019;s dray with magnificent horses, brasses gleaming, a barrow boy selling apples, and a hansom cab, the driver flicking his long whip above his horse&#x2019;s ears, as if it could go any faster in that traffic.<br><br>The lady was speaking to a man with one leg. He was leaning on a crutch, awkwardly, and trying to fish in his pocket with the other hand.<br><br>The lady smiled and said something. She picked a second bunch of white heather from the tray suspended around the man&#x2019;s neck and put her other hand gently on his arm, to stop him looking any further for change.<br><br>He could be a soldier from the Crimean War. Worm knew about that. Of course, it was twelve years ago now&#x2014;�1854&#x2013;�56, long before Worm was even born&#x2014;�but those who saw it and those who didn&#x2019;t see it had still all lost someone, and they didn&#x2019;t forget.<br><br>The lady with the light in her face was moving away now. The one-�legged man smiled as he watched her go and, without thinking about it, Worm followed her. He had no idea where she was going, but he wanted to look at her a little longer. He wouldn&#x2019;t get lost. He had always made his home somewhere around here, close to the river, until early last summer when someone had found him and taken him to live in the clinic on Portpool Lane. He had fended pretty well for himself on this bank, picking up bits of coal, or even brass when he was lucky, and selling it. He knew his way around.<br><br>Claudine would be cross with him for being late, but after telling him off a bit, she would forgive him. She always did. Even when he didn&#x2019;t have a front tooth, the smile always worked. His new teeth were almost grown through now.<br><br>The lady was moving quite quickly. He nearly lost her, except that the clouds parted for a moment and a shaft of sunlight fell on her, making her hair bright for an instant. Worm pushed past a man in a heavy topcoat, just in time to see a man with gray hair walk up to the lady and put a hand on her arm.<br><br>She flinched, as if he had gripped her too hard, and swung round to face him, anger in her eyes. Then, as though steeling herself, she stood a little straighter and said something to him that Worm was too far away to hear, but it was clear from her face that she was angry.<br><br>The man&#x2019;s expression became a twisted sneer and he pulled her toward him. No one else in the crowd took any notice. Was it a private quarrel with her father? Or an employer? Her clothes were ordinary; it was only her grace in wearing them that made them look good.<br><br>The man pulled her again, roughly. She resisted and with her free hand slapped him hard across the face. Then instantly she looked terrified, as if realizing what she had done when it was too late.<br><br>He was furious. He snarled something.<br><br>Worm ran forward, shouting, &#x201c;Stop it! Stop it!&#x201d; Maybe there was nothing he could do, but he would try. He could kick really hard! And if he got hold of someone&#x2019;s hand, he could bite. He charged at the man, head bent down to butt him in the stomach.<br><br>At that moment, another man appeared, quite a lot younger. He was taller and slimmer and clean-�shaven.<br><br>&#x201c;Fool!&#x201d; he shouted at the older man, and before the older man could confront the lady again, or Worm could kick him in the stomach, the younger man had pulled the lady out of the way. She fell forward against him, and he put his hand on her and twisted her round, pulling her with him. She struggled for only an instant, then seemed to give up the fight and follow obediently. Perhaps she was afraid of being hurt again, or worse?<br><br>The older man swore, then followed after them. Nobody appeared to have noticed Worm. He squeezed between two women with bags of laundry. They were so deep in conversation that they only swatted at him with one hand, for his impertinence, without missing a word.<br><br>He could still see the older man, and he ran after him across an open space in the street, just behind a costermonger&#x2019;s barrow full of vegetables and in front of a hansom whose driver was shouting at everyone to get out of the way. Might as well yell at the incoming tide, Worm thought, but some people felt better for complaining. Gave them the idea they were doing something.<br><br>He could still see the older man as he turned a corner into an alley. Worm usually had more sense than to go into dark corners, but this time there was no help for it. He ran past an old woman with a dog, swerved round the corner, and thanked whatever heaven there was that the older man was still in sight, not far ahead. He had caught up with the younger one, who continued holding on to the lady. Was she all right? Had they hurt her again?<br><br>If he didn&#x2019;t want to be seen, Worm should hang back. But if he did that, he would not know which way they went. What use was following anyone if he did not go all the way? He walked quickly and quite quietly, since his boots were very thin, one stage before getting actual holes. He did not like to tell anyone at the clinic because he knew they needed all the money for the sick people. It was a pretty big thing that they gave him food every single day and a bedroom of his own, with a real bed and blankets. He knew enough not to be greedy.<br><br>At the end of the alley, they turned left. That was inland, away from the river. Worm did not know this area so well. The river was his; at least it used to be. Now he lived inland a bit, and west of the patch of the bank he knew best. This was going east and inland, toward Mile End.<br><br>Still, he had to find out where they were taking the lady. He followed them silently for what seemed like a long time. He could still see her. But he couldn&#x2019;t see if she was struggling, or if they held her so tightly that she couldn&#x2019;t. She must be frightened.<br><br>He was catching up. He moved quickly, darting in front of a wagon and causing the driver to yell a string of imaginative abuses at him. The older man turned round, maybe at the color of the words. For a moment, his eyes met Worm&#x2019;s. Worm froze. The wagon passed so close to him, the driver reached out and cuffed his ear. It stung, but Worm ignored him.<br><br>The older man, still holding hard on the lady&#x2019;s arm, shouted at Worm, &#x201c;Get out of &#x2019;ere, or I&#x2019;ll tan yer &#x2019;ide till it falls off yer skinny bones!&#x201d;<br><br>The lady turned and saw Worm. There was recognition in her face. She opened her mouth as if to say something, but the younger man pulled her so hard she staggered against him.<br><br>A group of people with a vegetable cart passed in front of Worm, and when he looked again, the pavement was empty. The lady was gone, and so were the two men who had taken her.<br><br>Worm spent a long time looking for them, but he found no sign. Did that mean they were inside a house near here? He couldn&#x2019;t ask anyone: &#x201c;Have you seen a lady who smiles, with the sun in her hair? And two men who were taking her somewhere she didn&#x2019;t want to go?&#x201d;<br><br>There was nothing to do but go all the way back to the clinic, where at least he would get something to eat. He was hungry and cold, and his legs ached. There was definitely a hole in his boot now, and it was going to freeze tonight. But what could you expect? It was nearly Christmas.<br><br>He turned round slowly and started to walk westward. He would strike a main street he knew before too long.</p><h2>365 Days For Travelers - Wisdom from Chinese Literary and Buddhist Classics [Chinese-English Edition]</h2><p>A daybook of readings from the Chinese and Buddhist tradition in English and Chinese side-by-side</p><p></p><h2>Gathering Of Shadows</h2><p>Gathering of Shadows</p><p>V.E.

But now comes a different approach, as two legal scholars provide an in-depth survey of "comedy on trial"-the five years of censorship, arrests, obscenity trials, convictions and appeals as prosecutors sought to bust Bruce for "word crimes." Skover and Collins (coauthors of The Death of Discourse) meticulously document both litigation and the literary scene of the 1960s, crosscutting between clubs and courtrooms to show how Bruce's career crumbled in a nightmarish fashion as he broke taboos and struggled for free speech in the years before his death from a morphine overdose. Looking for a lawyer in 1964, Bruce requested, "Get me somebody who swings with the First Amendment," and that year noted performers and writers (such as William Styron, John Updike, James Baldwin) signed a petition to support Bruce, while others (Jules Feiffer, Jason Epstein, even the "prim and proper" Dorothy Kilgallen) served as defense witnesses. Granted access to Bruce's papers, Collins and Skover have done exhaustive research, also interviewing Bruce's lawyers, club owners, cohorts and comic talents, including Orson Bean, George Carlin, Margaret Cho and Paul Krassner. The voice of Bruce springs to life with his memorable comedy routines heard on the accompanying CD, narrated by Nat Hentoff and also featuring interviews with Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Hugh Hefner and others who reflect on Bruce's legacy. Generating a gamut of emotions, the entire package is an important documentation of a revolution in American culture.

Whether a jury would convict the attractive young couple was another story altogether.<br><br>McManus risks his entire <i>Harper</i>&#x2019;s advance in a long-shot attempt to play in the tournament himself. Only with actual table experience, he tells his skeptical wife, can he capture the hair-raising brand of poker that determines the world champion. The heart of the book is his deliciously suspenseful account of the tournament itself&#x2014;the players, the hand-to-hand combat, and his own unlikely progress in it.<br><br>Written in the tradition of <i>The Gambler </i>and <i>The Biggest Game in Town, Positively Fifth Street</i> is a high-stakes adventure, a penetrating study of America&#x2019;s card game, and a terrifying but often hilarious account of one man&#x2019;s effort to understand what Edward O. Wilson has called &#x201c;Pleistocene exigencies&#x201d;&#x2014;the eros and logistics of our primary competitive instincts.<br><br></p><p>In 2000, novelist and poet James McManus was sent to Las Vegas, innocently enough, by <i>Harper's</i> magazine to write a story about the World Series of Poker held annually at Binion's Horseshoe. But then, as so often happens on trips to Sin City, something kind of ... happened. Rather than becoming an objective report, McManus's article evolved into a memoir as he put his entire advance on the line, got lucky with his cards and won a spot in the competition, and came much closer than anyone expected to winning the darn thing. The result, <i>Positively Fifth Street</i>, is just as dazzling, exciting, and disturbing as Vegas itself. <p> McManus details his battles not only against his opponents but also against "Bad Jim," the portion of his own personality that needs to get in on a poker game in spite of both common and fiscal sense. Besides telling his own story, he relates the considerably more unpleasant tale of Ted Binion, whose grisly death was blamed on Binion's former stripper-girlfriend and her ex-linebacker beau. In the hands of a lesser author, the pursuit of these separate through lines of poker and the seedy personal lives of wealthy casino heirs may have lead readers to wish the author had picked just one subject. But under McManus's careful watch, they're really pretty similar: steeped in adrenaline, mystery, deception, and skating on thrillingly thin ice. Each story underscores the other, a neat little "narrative as metaphor" device, while also painting a vivid picture of Vegas casino life. Poker, as anyone who has lost at it will tell you, is an intricate game and it's nice to see a top-notch author and player relate its finer points in an entertaining style that will appeal even to non-players.

We see a man who concealed his anxieties behind the mask of a genial Westchester squire&#x2014;a paterfamilias in Brooks Brothers clothes whose world was peopled by legendary writers and beautiful women (Malcolm Cowley, Saul Bellow, William Maxwell, Hope Lange, and John Updike, among them); whose groundbreaking work landed him on the covers of <i>Time</i> and <i>Newsweek;</i> a man whose demons and desperation were never quite vanquished by the joy he found in his work.<br><br>Blake Bailey has written a luminous biography, a revelation of a writer of timeless fiction and of the man behind the page.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best of the Month, March 2009</strong>: In Blake Bailey's monumental, masterful, and, at nearly 800 pages, mammoth biography, <i>Cheever: A Life</i>, the author of <em>A Tragic Honesty: The Life and Work of Richard Yates</em> turns his attention to the "the Chekhov of the suburbs" and his storied, celebrated, and deeply tortured life. Written with compassion and the full cooperation of Cheever's widow, Mary, and their three children, <i>Cheever</i> is rich with detail and chronicles the mournful arc of a lifetime struggling with a core duplicity that ached throughout his writing life--despite a 41-year marriage, Cheever was a closeted bisexual who simmered with self-loathing. Bailey covers the author's childhood, his time in the army, his life as a writer and his literary rivals (Salinger, in particular, seemed to irritate him), his alcoholism (he would struggle against taking that first "scoop" of gin from the pantry every morning while he was writing), and his struggle to play the role of suburban family man. The book is peppered with literary cameos: Updike, Bellow, and Roth are there, along with his Iowa Writers' Workshop students T.C. Boyle, Ron Hansen, and Allan Gurganus. (While at Iowa Cheever made it a weekly ritual to watch <i>Monday Night Football</i> and eat homemade pasta with fellow instructor John Irving.) Bailey also edited two Library of America editions of Cheever's stories and novels published to coincide with his biography. This literary hat trick will no doubt spark a well-deserved Cheever renaissance honoring his legacy as an American master. <i>--Brad Thomas Parsons</i>Blake Bailey is the editor of a two-volume edition of Cheever&#x2019;s work, published in 2009 by The Library of America. His last book, <i>A Tragic Honesty,</i> was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award. He received a Guggenheim fellowship in 2005, and his articles and reviews have appeared in <i>Slate,</i> <i>The New York Times, </i>the <i>New York Observer,</i> and elsewhere.

Yes, we were originally from Dalmatia, and the family name would then have been something like Pavlo. The first of my forebears to sail to Venice, and stay here, did so sometime after the year 1000. He and his descendants must have risen rather quickly to prominence in Venice, for already in the year 1094 a Dom�nico Polo was a member of the Grand Council of the Republic, and in the following century so was a Piero Polo.The most remote ancestor of whom I have even a dim recollection was my grandfather Andrea. By his time, every man of our house of Polo was officially designated an Ene Aca (meaning N.H., which in Venice means Nobilis Homo or gentleman), and was addressed as Messere, and we had acquired the family arms: a field argent bearing three birds sable with beaks gules. This is actually a visual play on words, for that emblematic bird of ours is the bold and industrious jackdaw, which is called in the Venetian tongue the pola.Nono Andrea had three sons: my uncle Marco, for whom I wasnamed, my father Nicol� and my uncle Maf�o. What they did when they were boys I do not know, but when they grew up, the eldest son, Marco, became the Polo trading company's agent in Constantinople in the Latin Empire, while his brothers remained in Venice to manage the company's headquarters and keep up the family palazzo. Not until after Nono Andrea's death did Nicol� and Maf�o scratch the itch to go traveling themselves, but when they did they went farther than any Polo before them had gone.In the year 1259, when they sailed away from Venice, I was five years old. My father had told my mother that they intended to go only as far as Constantinople, to visit their long-absent elder brother. But, as that brother eventually reported to my mother, after they had stayed with him there for a time, they took a notion to go on eastward. She never heard another report of them, and, after a twelvemonth, she decided they must be dead. That was not just the vaporings of an abandoned and grieving woman; it was the most likely possible surmise. For it was in that year of 1259 that the barbarian Mongols, having conquered all the rest of the Eastern world, pushed their implacable advance to the very gates of Constantinople. While every other white man was fleeing or quailing before "the Golden Horde," Maf�o and Nicol� Polo had gone marching foolhardily right into their front line--or, considering how the Mongols were then regarded, better say: into their slavering and champing jaws.We had reason to regard the Mongols as monsters, did we not? The Mongols were something more and something less than human, were they not? More than human, in their fighting ability and physical endurance. Less than human, in their savagery and lust for blood. Even their everyday food was known to be reeking raw meat and the rancid milk of mares. And it was known that, when a Mongol army ran out of those rations, it would unhesitatingly cast lots to choose every tenth man of its ranks to be slaughtered for food for the others. It was known that every Mongol warrior wore leather armor only on his breast, not his back; so that, if he ever <i>did</i> feel cowardice, he could not turn and run from an opponent. It was known that the Mongols polished their leather armor with grease, and they procured that grease by boiling down their human victims. All those things were known in Venice, and were repeated and retold, in hushed voices of horror, and some of those things were even true.I was just five years old when my father went away, but I could share the universal dread of those savages from the East, for I was already familiar with the spoken threat: "The Mongols will get you! The orda will get you!" I had heard that all through my childhood, and so had every other little boy whenever he required admonishment. "The orda will get you if you do not eat up all your supper. If you do not go straight to bed. If you do not cease your noise." The orda was wielded by mothers and governesses, in those times, as they had earlier threatened their misbehaving children with "The orco will get you!"The orco is the demon giant that mothers and nursemaids have forever kept on call, so it was no strain for them to substitute the wordorda: the horde. And the Mongol horde was assuredly the more real and believable monster; the women invoking it did not have to feign the fright in their voices. The fact that they even knew that word is evidence that they had reason to fear the orda as much as any child did. For it was the Mongols' own word, yurtu, originally meaning the great pavilioned tent of the chieftain of a Mongol encampment, and it was adopted, only slightly changed, into all the European languages, to mean what Europeans thought of when they thought of Mongols--a marching mob, a teeming mass, an irresistible swarm, a horde.But I did not much longer hear that threat from my mother. As soon as she decided that my father was dead and gone, she commenced to languish and dwindle and weaken. When I was seven years old, she died. I have only one recollection of her, from a few months before that. The last time she ventured outside our Casa Polo, before she took to her bed and never got up again, was to accompany me on the day I was enrolled in school. Indeed, although that day was in another century, nearly sixty years ago, I recall it quite clearly.At that time, our Ca' Polo was a small palazzo in the city's confino of San Felice. In the bright morning hour of mezza-terza, my mother and I came out the house door onto the cobbled street alongside the canal. Our old boatman, the black Nubian slave Michi�l, was waiting with our bat�lo moored to its striped pole, and the boat was freshly waxed for the occasion, gleaming in all its colors. My mother and I got into it and seated ourselves under the canopy. Also for the occasion, I was dressed in new and fine raiment: a tunic of brown Lucca silk, I remember, and hose soled with leather. So, as old Michi�l rowed us down the narrow Rio San Felice, he kept exclaiming things like "Che zentil�mo!" and "Dass�no, xestu, Messer Marco?"--meaning "Quite the gentleman!" and "Truly, is that you, Master Marco?"--which unaccustomed admiration made me feel proud and uncomfortable. He did not desist until he turned the bat�lo into the Grand Canal, where the heavy boat traffic required all his attention.That day was one of Venice's best sort of days. The sun was shining, but its light lay on the city in a manner more diffused than sharp-edged. There was no sea mist or land haze, for the sunlight was by no means diminished. Rather, the sun seemed to shine not in direct beams, but with a more subtle luminosity, the way candles glow when they are set in a many-crystaled chandelier. Anyone who knows Venice has known that light : as if pearls had been crushed and powdered--pearl-colored pearls and the pale pink ones and the pale blue--and that powder ground so fine that its particles hung in the air, not dimming the light but making it more lustrous yet soft at the same time. And the light came from other places than the sky alone. It was reflected from the canals' dancing waters, so it put dapples and spangles and roundels of that pearl-powder light bouncing about on all the walls of old wood and brick and stone, and softened their rough textures as well. That day had a gentling bloom on it like the bloom on a peach.Our boat slid under the Grand Canal's one bridge, the Ponte Rialto --the old, low, pontoon bridge with the swing-away center section; ithad not then been rebuilt as the arched drawbridge it is now. Then we passed the Erbar�a, the market where young men, after a night of wine, go strolling in the early morning to clear their heads with the fragrance of its flowers and herbs and fruits. Then we turned off the canal again into another narrow one. A little way up that, my mother and I debarked at the Campo San Todaro. Around that square are situated all the lower-grade schools of the city, and at that hour the open space seethed with boys of all ages, playing, running, chattering, wrestling, while they waited for the school day to begin.My mother presented me to the school maistro, presenting him also with the documents pertaining to my birth and to my registry in the Libro d'Oro. ("The Golden Book" is the popular name for the Register of Protocol in which the Republic keeps the records of all its Ene Aca families. ) Fra Varisto, a very stout and forbidding man in voluminous robes, appeared less than impressed by the documents. He looked at them and snorted, "Brate!" which is a not very polite word meaning a Slav or Dalmatian. My mother countered with a ladylike sniff, and murmured, "Venezi�n nato e spu�.""Venetian spawned and born, perhaps," rumbled the friar. "But Venetian <i>bred,</i> not yet. Not until he has endured proper schooling and the stiffening of school discipline."He took up a quill and rubbed the point of it on the shiny skin of his tonsure, I suppose to lubricate its nib, then dipped it in an inkwell and opened a tremendous book. "Date of Confirmation?" he inquired. "Of First Communion?"My mother told him and added, with some hauteur, that I had not, like most children, been allowed to forget my Catechism as soon as I had been confirmed, but could still say it and the Creed and the Commandments on demand, as facilely as I could say the Our Father. The maistro grunted, but made no additional notation in his big book. My mother then went on to ask some questions of her own: about the school's curriculum and its examinations and its rewards for achievement and its punishments for failure and ...All mothers take their sons to school for the first time with a considerable pride, I suppose, but also, I think, with an equal measure of wariness and even sadness, for they are relinquishing those sons to a mysterious realm they never can enter. Almost no female, unless she is destined for holy orders, ever gets the least bit of formal schooling. So her son, as soon as he learns just so much as to write his own name, has vaulted somewhere beyond her reach forever after.Fra Varisto patiently told my mother that I would be taught the proper use of my own language and of Trade French as well, that I would be taught to read and to write and to figure in numbers, that I would learn at least the rudiments of Latin from the <i>Timen</i> of Donadello, and the rudiments of history and cosmography from Callisthenes' <i>Book of Alexander,</i> and religion from Bible stories. But my mother persisted with so many other anxious questions that the friar finally said, in a voice mingling compassion and exasperation, "Dona e Madona, the boy is merely being enrolled in school. He is not taking the veil. We will immurehim merely during the daylight hours. You will still have him the rest of the time."She had me for the rest of her life, but that was not long. So thereafter I heard the threat that "the Mongols will get you if" only from Fra Varisto at school, and at home from old Zuli�. This was a woman who really was a Slav, born in some back corner of Bohemia, and clearly of peasant stock, for she always walked like a washerwoman waddling with a full wash bucket dangling from either hand. She had been my mother's personal maid since before I was born. After my mother's death, Zuli� took her place as my nurse and monitor, and took the courtesy title of Aunt. In assuming the task of raising me up to be a decent and responsible young man, Zia Zuli� did not exert much strictness--apart from frequently invoking the orda--nor did she, I must confess, have much success in her self-appointed task.In part, this was because my namesake Uncle Marco had not come back to Venice after the disappearance of his two brothers. He had for too long made his home in Constantinople, and was comfortable there, although by this time the Latin Empire had succumbed to the Byzantine. Since my other uncle and my father had left the family business in the keeping of expert and trustworthy clerks, and the family palazzo in the keeping of similarly efficient domestics, Zio Marco left them so. Only the most weighty but least urgent matters were referred to him, by courier vessel, for his consideration and decision. Managed in that manner, both the Compagnia Polo and the Ca' Polo went on functioning as well as ever.The one Polo property that misfunctioned was myself. Being the last and sole male scion of the Polo line--the only one in Venice, anyway--I had to be tenderly preserved, and I knew it. Though I was not of an age to have any say in the management of either the business or the house (fortunately), neither was I answerable to any adult authority for my own actions. At home I demanded my own way, and I got it. Not Zia Zuli�, nor the maggiordomo, old Attilio, nor any of the lesser servants dared to raise a hand against me, and seldom a voice. My Catechism I never again recited, and soon forgot all the responses. At school I began to shirk my lessons. When Fra Varisto despaired of wielding the Mongols and resorted to wielding a ferrule, I simply stayed away from school.It is a small wonder that I got as much formal education as I did. But I remained in school long enough to learn to read and write and do arithmetic and speak the Trade French of commerce, mainly because I knew I should need those abilities when I grew old enough to take over the family business. And I learned what history of the world, and what description of it, is supplied by <i>The Book of Alexander.</i> I absorbed all of that, mainly because the great Alexander's journeys of conquest had taken him eastward, and I could imagine my father and uncle having followed some of the same trails. But I saw little likelihood of my ever needing a knowledge of Latin, and it was when my school class had its collective nose forced into the boring rules and precepts of the <i>Timen</i> that I pointed my nose elsewhere.Though my seniors loudly lamented and predicted dire ends for me, I really do not think that my willfulness signified that I was an evil child. My chief besetting sin was curiosity, but of course that is a sin by our Western standards. Tradition insists that we behave in conformity with our neighbors and peers. The Holy Church demands that we believe and have faith, that we stifle any questions or opinions derived from our own reasoning. The Venetian mercantile philosophy decrees that the only palpable truths are those numerated on the bottommost ledger line where debits and credits are balanced.But something in my nature rebelled against the constraints accepted by all others of my age and class and situation. I wished to live a life beyond the rules and the ruled ledger lines and the lines written in the Missal. I was impatient and perhaps distrustful of received wisdom, those morsels of information and exhortation so neatly selected and prepared and served up like courses of a meal, for consumption and assimilation. I much preferred to make my own hunt for knowledge, even if I found it raw and unpalatable to chew and nauseating to swallow, as often I would do. My guardians and preceptors accused me of lazy avoidance of the hard work required to gain an education. They never realized that I had chosen to follow a far harder path, and would follow it--wherever it led--from that childhood time through all the years of my manhood.On the days when I stayed away from the school and could not go home, I h...</p><h2>Self-Steering for Sailing Craft</h2><p>Anyone who has sailed alone or short-handed offshore knows the importance of getting the boat to steer herself.

Indeed, this veteran's profound disillusionment with war suffuses the work, but a polemic against the Bush administration this is not; while Zinn scarcely shies from critiquing the governing elite, he prefers to focus on little-known or underappreciated historical episodes such as Revolutionary War soldiers driven to mutiny or 1999 World Trade Organization protestors in Seattle. He also revisits and reframes well-known events, including the Boston Massacre and the Holocaust, and invokes figures like union organizer Eugene Debs and Vietnam War protestor Philip Berrigan to point the way forward. Though his observations can be bleak, Zinn's belief that "history is powerful" and will "break down the credibility of the war makers" gives his book a great sense of hope. Readers seeking to break out of their ideological comfort zones will find much to ponder here.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Retired now, he still wakes early and remembers how mornings used to be his favorite, as though the world were his secret, tires rumbling softly beneath him and the light emerging through the early fog, the brief sight of the bay off to his right, then the pines, tall and slender, and almost always he rode with the window partly open because he loved the smell of the pines and the heavy salt air, and in the winter he loved the smell of the cold. The pharmacy was a small two-story building attached to another building that housed separately a hardware store and a small grocery. Each morning Henry parked in the back by the large metal bins, and then entered the pharmacy&#x2019;s back door, and went about switching on the lights, turning up the thermostat, or, if it was summer, getting the fans going. He would open the safe, put money in the register, unlock the front door, wash his hands, put on his white lab coat. The ritual was pleasing, as though the old store&#x2014;with its shelves of toothpaste, vitamins, cosmetics, hair adornments, even sewing needles and greeting cards, as well as red rubber hot water bottles, enema pumps&#x2014;was a person altogether steady and steadfast. And any unpleasantness that may have occurred back in his home, any uneasiness at the way his wife often left their bed to wander through their home in the night&#x2019;s dark hours&#x2014;all this receded like a shoreline as he walked through the safety of his pharmacy. Standing in the back, with the drawers and rows of pills, Henry was cheerful when the phone began to ring, cheerful when Mrs. Merriman came for her blood pressure medicine, or old Cliff Mott arrived for his digitalis, cheerful when he prepared the Valium for Rachel Jones, whose husband ran off the night their baby was born. It was Henry&#x2019;s nature to listen, and many times during the week he would say, &#x201c;Gosh, I&#x2019;m awful sorry to hear that,&#x201d; or &#x201c;Say, isn&#x2019;t that something?&#x201d; Inwardly, he suffered the quiet trepidations of a man who had witnessed twice in childhood the nervous breakdowns of a mother who had otherwise cared for him with stridency. And so if, as rarely happened, a customer was distressed over a price, or irritated by the quality of an Ace bandage or ice pack, Henry did what he could to rectify things quickly. For many years Mrs. Granger worked for him; her husband was a lobster fisherman, and she seemed to carry with her the cold breeze of the open water, not so eager to please a wary customer. He had to listen with half an ear as he filled prescriptions, to make sure she was not at the cash register dismissing a complaint. More than once he was reminded of that same sensation in watching to see that his wife, Olive, did not bear down too hard on Christopher over a homework assignment or a chore left undone; that sense of his attention hovering&#x2014;the need to keep everyone content. When he heard a briskness in Mrs. Granger&#x2019;s voice, he would step down from his back post, moving toward the center of the store to talk with the customer himself. Otherwise, Mrs. Granger did her job well. He appreciated that she was not chatty, kept perfect inventory, and almost never called in sick. That she died in her sleep one night astonished him, and left him with some feeling of responsibility, as though he had missed, working alongside her for years, whatever symptom might have shown itself that he, handling his pills and syrups and syringes, could have fixed. &#x201c;Mousy,&#x201d; his wife said, when he hired the new girl. &#x201c;Looks just like a mouse.&#x201d; Denise Thibodeau had round cheeks, and small eyes that peeped through her brown-framed glasses. &#x201c;But a nice mouse,&#x201d; Henry said. &#x201c;A cute one.&#x201d; &#x201c;No one&#x2019;s cute who can&#x2019;t stand up straight,&#x201d; Olive said. It was true that Denise&#x2019;s narrow shoulders sloped forward, as though apologizing for something. She was twenty-two, just out of the state university of Vermont. Her husband was also named Henry, and Henry Kitteridge, meeting Henry Thibodeau for the first time, was taken with what he saw as an unself-conscious excellence. The young man was vigorous and sturdy-featured with a light in his eye that seemed to lend a flickering resplendence to his decent, ordinary face. He was a plumber, working in a business owned by his uncle. He and Denise had been married one year. &#x201c;Not keen on it,&#x201d; Olive said, when he suggested they have the young couple to dinner. Henry let it drop. This was a time when his son&#x2014;not yet showing the physical signs of adolescence&#x2014;had become suddenly and strenuously sullen, his mood like a poison shot through the air, and Olive seemed as changed and changeable as Christopher, the two having fast and furious fights that became just as suddenly some blanket of silent intimacy where Henry, clueless, stupefied, would find himself to be the odd man out. But standing in the back parking lot at the end of a late summer day, while he spoke with Denise and Henry Thibodeau, and the sun tucked itself behind the spruce trees, Henry Kitteridge felt such a longing to be in the presence of this young couple, their faces turned to him with a diffident but eager interest as he recalled his own days at the university many years ago, that he said, &#x201c;Now, say. Olive and I would like you to come for supper soon.&#x201d; He drove home, past the tall pines, past the glimpse of the bay, and thought of the Thibodeaus driving the other way, to their trailer on the outskirts of town. He pictured the trailer, cozy and picked up&#x2014;for Denise was neat in her habits&#x2014;and imagined them sharing the news of their day. Denise might say, &#x201c;He&#x2019;s an easy boss.&#x201d; And Henry might say, &#x201c;Oh, I like the guy a lot.&#x201d; He pulled into his driveway, which was not a driveway so much as a patch of lawn on top of the hill, and saw Olive in the garden. &#x201c;Hello, Olive,&#x201d; he said, walking to her. He wanted to put his arms around her, but she had a darkness that seemed to stand beside her like an acquaintance that would not go away. He told her the Thibodeaus were coming for supper. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s only right,&#x201d; he said. Olive wiped sweat from her upper lip, turned to rip up a clump of onion grass. &#x201c;Then that&#x2019;s that, Mr. President,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Give your order to the cook.&#x201d; On Friday night the couple followed him home, and the young Henry shook Olive&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;Nice place here,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;With that view of the water. Mr. Kitteridge says you two built this yourselves.&#x201d; &#x201c;Indeed, we did.&#x201d; Christopher sat sideways at the table, slumped in adolescent gracelessness, and did not respond when Henry Thibodeau asked him if he played any sports at school. Henry Kitteridge felt an unexpected fury sprout inside him; he wanted to shout at the boy, whose poor manners, he felt, revealed something unpleasant not expected to be found in the Kitteridge home. &#x201c;When you work in a pharmacy,&#x201d; Olive told Denise, setting before her a plate of baked beans, &#x201c;you learn the secrets of everyone in town.&#x201d; Olive sat down across from her, pushed forward a bottle of ketchup. &#x201c;Have to know to keep your mouth shut. But seems like you know how to do that.&#x201d; &#x201c;Denise understands,&#x201d; Henry Kitteridge said. Denise&#x2019;s husband said, &#x201c;Oh, sure. You couldn&#x2019;t find someone more trustworthy than Denise.&#x201d; &#x201c;I believe you,&#x201d; Henry said, passing the man a basket of rolls. &#x201c;And please. Call me Henry. One of my favorite names,&#x201d; he added. Denise laughed quietly; she liked him, he could see this. Christopher slumped farther into his seat. Henry Thibodeau&#x2019;s parents lived on a farm inland, and so the two Henrys discussed crops, and pole beans, and the corn not being as sweet this summer from the lack of rain, and how to get a good asparagus bed. &#x201c;Oh, for God&#x2019;s sake,&#x201d; said Olive, when, in passing the ketchup to the young man, Henry Kitteridge knocked it over, and ketchup lurched out like thickened blood across the oak table. Trying to pick up the bottle, he caused it to roll unsteadily, and ketchup ended up on his fingertips, then on his white shirt. &#x201c;Leave it,&#x201d; Olive commanded, standing up. &#x201c;Just leave it alone, Henry. For God&#x2019;s sake.&#x201d; And Henry Thibodeau, perhaps at the sound of his own name being spoken sharply, sat back, looking stricken. &#x201c;Gosh, what a mess I&#x2019;ve made,&#x201d; Henry Kitteridge said. For dessert they were each handed a blue bowl with a scoop of vanilla ice cream sliding in its center. &#x201c;Vanilla&#x2019;s my favorite,&#x201d; Denise said. &#x201c;Is it,&#x201d; said Olive. &#x201c;Mine, too,&#x201d; Henry Kitteridge said. As autumn came, the mornings darker, and the pharmacy getting only a short sliver of the direct sun before it passed over the building and left the store lit by its own overhead lights, Henry stood in the back filling the small plastic bottles, answering the telephone, while Denise stayed up front near the cash register. At lunchtime, she unwrapped a sandwich she brought from home, and ate it in the back where the storage was, and then he would eat his lunch, and sometimes when there was no one in the store, they would linger with a cup of coffee bought from the grocer next door. Denise seemed a naturally quiet girl, but she was given to spurts of sudden talkativeness. &#x201c;My mother&#x2019;s had MS for years, you know, so starting way back we all learned to help out. All three of my brothers are different. Don&#x2019;t you think it&#x2019;s funny when it happens that way?&#x201d; The oldest brother, Denise said, straightening a bottle of shampoo, had been her father&#x2019;s favorite until he&#x2019;d married a girl her father didn&#x2019;t like. Her own in-laws were wonderful, she said. She&#x2019;d had a boyfriend before Henry, a Protestant, and his parents had not been so kind to her. &#x201c;It wouldn&#x2019;t have worked out,&#x201d; she said, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. &#x201c;Well, Henry&#x2019;s a terrific young man,&#x201d; Henry answered. She nodded, smiling through her glasses like a thirteen-year-old girl. Again, he pictured her trailer, the two of them like overgrown puppies tumbling together; he could not have said why this gave him the particular kind of happiness it did, like liquid gold being poured through him. She was as efficient as Mrs. Granger had been, but more relaxed. &#x201c;Right beneath the vitamins in the second aisle,&#x201d; she would tell a customer. &#x201c;Here, I&#x2019;ll show you.&#x201d; Once, she told Henry she sometimes let a person wander around the store before asking if she could help them. &#x201c;That way, see, they might find something they didn&#x2019;t know they needed. And your sales will go up.&#x201d; A block of winter sun was splayed across the glass of the cosmetics shelf; a strip of wooden floor shone like honey. He raised his eyebrows appreciatively. &#x201c;Lucky for me, Denise, when you came through that door.&#x201d; She pushed up her glasses with the back of her hand, then ran the duster over the ointment jars. Jerry McCarthy, the boy who delivered the pharmaceuticals once a week from Portland&#x2014;or more often if needed&#x2014;would sometimes have his lunch in the back room. He was eighteen, right out of high school; a big, fat kid with a smooth face, who perspired so much that splotches of his shirt would be wet, at times even down over his breasts, so the poor fellow looked to be lactating. Seated on a crate, his big knees practically to his ears, he&#x2019;d eat a sandwich that had spilling from it mayonnaisey clumps of egg salad or tuna fish, landing on his shirt. More than once Henry saw Denise hand him a paper towel. &#x201c;That happens to me,&#x201d; Henry heard her say one day. &#x201c;Whenever I eat a sandwich that isn&#x2019;t just cold cuts, I end up a mess.&#x201d; It couldn&#x2019;t have been true. The girl was neat as a pin, if plain as a plate. &#x201c;Good afternoon,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d say when the telephone rang. &#x201c;This is the Village Pharmacy. How can I help you today?&#x201d; Like a girl playing grown-up. And then: On a Monday morning when the air in the pharmacy held a sharp chill, he went about opening up the store, saying, &#x201c;How was your weekend, Denise?&#x201d; Olive had refused to go to church the day before, and Henry, uncharacteristically, had spoken to her sharply. &#x201c;Is it too much to ask,&#x201d; he had found himself saying, as he stood in the kitchen in his undershorts, ironing his trousers. &#x201c;A man&#x2019;s wife accompanying him to church?&#x201d; Going without her seemed a public exposure of familial failure. &#x201c;Yes, it most certainly is too goddamn much to ask!&#x201d; Olive had almost spit, her fury&#x2019;s door flung open. &#x201c;You have no idea how tired I am, teaching all day, going to foolish meetings where the goddamn principal is a moron! Shopping. Cooking. Ironing. Laundry. Doing Christopher&#x2019;s homework with him! And you&#x2014;&#x201d; She had grabbed on to the back of a dining room chair, and her dark hair, still uncombed from its night&#x2019;s disarrangement, had fallen across her eyes. &#x201c;You, Mr. Head Deacon Claptrap Nice Guy, expect me to give up my Sunday mornings and go sit among a bunch of snot-wots!&#x201d; Very suddenly she had sat down in the chair. &#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m sick and tired of it,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d said, calmly. &#x201c;Sick to death.&#x201d; A darkness had rumbled through him; his soul was suffocating in tar. The next morning, Olive spoke to him conversationally. &#x201c;Jim&#x2019;s&nbsp; car smelled like upchuck last week. Hope he&#x2019;s cleaned it out.&#x201d; Jim&nbsp; O&#x2019;Casey taught with Olive, and for years took both Christopher and Olive to school. &#x201c;Hope so,&#x201d; said Henry, and in that way their fight was done. &#x201c;Oh, I had a wonderful weekend,&#x201d; said Denise, her small eyes behind her glasses looking at him with an eagerness that was so childlike it could have cracked his heart in two. &#x201c;We went to Henry&#x2019;s folks and dug potatoes at night. Henry put the headlights on from the car and we dug potatoes. Finding the potatoes in that cold soil&#x2014;like an Easter egg hunt!&#x201d; He stopped unpacking a shipment of penicillin, and stepped down to talk to her. There were no customers yet, and below the front window the radiator hissed. He said, &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t that lovely, Denise.&#x201d; She nodded, touching the top of the vitamin shelf beside her. A small motion of fear seemed to pass over her face. &#x201c;I got cold and went and sat in the car and watched Henry digging potatoes, and I thought: It&#x2019;s too good to be true.&#x201d;</p><h2>Foolproof Machine Quilting: Learn to Use Your Walking Foot Paper-Cut Patterns for No Marking, No Math Simple Stitching for Stunning Results</h2><p>Design and stitch beautiful machine quilting with the walking foot on your home sewing machine - no free-motion required!</p><p>Mary Mashuta is an award-winning quilter who has taught techniques of quilting for more than twenty years.

"Conversation," he said.</p><p>The AD held up a megaphone and shouted, "Conversation!"</p><p>At once, a hundred and fifty extras, packed into a set that was a replica of Sardi's, the famous theater-district restaurant in New York, began to talk.</p><p>"Acton," Rick said quietly.</p><p>"Speed," the camera operator replied.</p><p>Waiters began to move among the tables.</p><p>"Cue the entrance," Rick said.</p><p>"Entrance," the AD said into a microphone hanging around his neck. He signaled the dolly man, and the camera began to roll smoothly down the restaurant's main aisle toward the entrance of the restaurant.</p><p>The front door opened, and his leading lady, Glenna Gleason, wearing a gorgeous evening gown and followed by another actress and two actors, all in evening dress, walked in and were greeted by a Vincent Sardi look-alike. As they walked past the small bar and entered the dining room, the camera backtracked, and, on cue, all the diners stood and applauded.</p><p>Glenna managed to look shocked, then delighted as she followed "Sardi" to their table along the wall. The camera stopped and moved in closer as a microphone boom was lowered over the false wall to pick up their dialogue.</p><p>"My God," Glenna said, "I didn't know it would be like this."</p><p>The actor on her left turned to her. "Katherine," he said, "it's going to be like this from now on."</p><p>On Rick's signal, the camera began to dolly slowly away from the table and, keeping Glenna's party in the center of the frame, rose to a height of twelve feet and stopped.</p><p>"Keep the conversation going," Rick said from his chair on the boom next to the camera. He sat and watched the stopwatch in his hand for ninety seconds, which was what they needed to roll under the closing titles. "Cut!" he yelled, finally. "Print it! That's a wrap!" It was the fourth take, and it was perfect. They had shot the three scenes at Sardi's all on the same day, and now it was done: Rick had made his first feature film as a director. He sagged with relief as the camera operator pounded him on the back.</p><p>Then, to his astonishment, every actor on the set rose from his seat and gave the director a standing ovation. Rick stood up, holding on to the camera for support, then turned and faced the bulk of the crowd, "Cut!" he yelled again. "Start the party!"</p><p>A part of the rear wall of the set was rolled away, revealing a huge buffet table and a bar serving real booze instead of the tea in the prop glasses on the table. The crowd of extras surged toward the food and drink, and Rick signaled the boom operator to lower the camera to the floor. He hopped off and slid into a banquette beside his wife, giving her a big kiss. "Glenna, my darling, that was great. It's going to be wonderful, the whole thing."</p><p>Two of the actors got up from the table and made way for Eddie Harris, the chairman of Centurion Studios, and Sidney Brooks, the famous New York playwright, who had written the script for <i>Times Square Dance.</i></p><p>"Rick," Eddie said, "congratulations."</p><p>Champagne appeared and was poured.</p><p>"I thought the last scene went beautifully," Brooks said to everybody.</p><p>"Sid, we're going to do your script proud," Rick said. "Just give me a couple of days, and I'll show you a rough cut."</p><p>"I can't wait," Brooks replied.</p><p>"I have to go pee," Glenna said, and Rick let her out of the banquette. The actor playing her husband got up, too, leaving Rick, Eddie Harris and Sidney Brooks at the table.</p><p>"Fellas," Brooks said, "I have to tell you something."</p><p>Rick looked at the man across the table. For the first time since he had met the playwright, the man looked less than happy.</p><p>"What's up, Sid?" Eddie asked.</p><p>"I wanted to tell you before it hits the papers tomorrow," Brooks said.</p><p>"Tell us what?" Rick asked.</p><p>"I've been subpoenaed by the House of Un-American Activities Committee, along with eighteen other people, mostly writers but a few actors and one director."</p><p>"Oh, shit," Eddie said. "Well, don't worry about it; get a good lawyer."</p><p>"I'm sorry, Sid," Rick said, "But Eddie is right about the lawyer."</p><p>"There's a meeting tomorrow," Brooks replied. "I want to tell you fellows..."</p><p>"You don't need to tell us anything," Eddie said.</p><p>"You mean, you'd rather not know, don't you Eddie?"</p><p>"The first thing your lawyer is going to tell you is to shut up," Eddie said. "I'm just giving you a head start; don't say anything to anybody, unless your lawyer approves it first."</p><p>"I'm not looking to drag anybody into this," Brooks said. "I just want to be honest with you. This picture has been the best experience I've had since I came out here four years ago; it's the first picture that's given me the same sort of satisfaction that writing a play used to."</p><p>"Look, Sid," Rick said, "these people are going to hold their hearings, grill some movie stars, and then it'll be over. Six months from now you'll have put it behind you."</p><p>Brooks set his briefcase on the table, opened it and pulled out a thick manila envelope. "I've been working on this for two years," he said. "I've never told anybody about it, but it's the best thing I've ever written for either the stage or film, and after the wonderful experience I've had with the production of <i>Times Square Dance</i>, I want you fellows to produce it, and, Rick, I'd be delighted if you'd direct again."</p><p>"Thank you, Sid," Rick said, and he meant it. "I'll read it tonight."</p><p>"Tell your agent to call Rick in the morning," Eddie said, "We'll have a deal before lunchtime."</p><p>"But you haven't even read it, Eddie," Brooks said, laughing.</p><p>"I don't need to. I'll buy it sight unseen."</p><p>Rick knew that wasn't quite true, but he knew that Eddie expected to like the script; he would want Rick's opinion first, though.</p><p>"It's a western," Brooks said.</p><p>"<i>What</i>?" Rick exclaimed. "The theater's urban genius has written a western?"</p><p>"The grittiest, down-and-dirtiest western you ever saw," Brooks said. "I love westerns, and I've always wanted to write one; to tell you the truth, it's the principal reason I came out here, just to get the opportunity.

What should have been for the Israelites a brief journey from Mount Sinai to the Holy Land becomes a forty-year death march. Both before and after the devastating report of the Spies, the narrative centers on the people&#x2019;s desire to return to Egypt, to undo the miraculous work of the Exodus. At its heart are speeches of complaint and lament, expressing a profound existential skepticism. But by contrast, in the narrative of the book of Numbers that is found in mystical and Hasidic sources, the generation of the wilderness emerges as one of extraordinary spiritual experience, receivers of the Torah to the fullest extent, fed on miracles and nurtured directly by God: a generation of ecstatic faith, human partners in an unprecedented conversation with the Deity. Drawing on kabbalistic sources, the Hasidic commentators on the book of Numbers depict a people who transcend prudent considerations in order to follow God into the wilderness, where their spiritual yearning comes to full expression.<br> &nbsp;<br> This view of the wilderness history invites us into a different kind of listening to the many cries of distrust, lament, and resentment that issue from the Israelites throughout the book of Numbers. Is there a way to integrate this narrative of dark murmurings, of obsessive fantasies of return to Egypt, with the celebration of a love-intoxicated wilderness discourse? The question touches not only on the language the Israelites speak but also on the very nature of human utterance. Who are these people? Who are we who listen to them? What effect does the cumulative trauma of slavery, the miracles of Exodus, the revelation at Sinai, have on a nation that is beginning to speak? In <i>Bewilderments,</i> one of the most admired biblical commentators at work today posits fascinating answers to these questions through the magnificent literary, scholarly, and psychological analysis of the text that is her trademark.</p><p><b>Avivah Gottlieb Zornberg</b> is the author of <i>The Beginning of Desire: Reflections on Genesis,&nbsp;The Particulars of Rapture: Reflections on Exodus, The Murmuring Deep: Reflections on the Biblical Unconscious </i>and <i>Moses:&nbsp;A&nbsp;Human&nbsp;Life</i>. She lectures widely in Israel, the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. She lives in Jerusalem.<b>PREAMBLE</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b><i>Bewilderments</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> The Hebrew name for the book of Numbers is Sefer Bamidbar, the Book of (lit.) In-the-Wilderness. Although the Israelite wilderness experience begins in Exodus and concludes in Deuteronomy, the book of Numbers claims the interior of this world of wilderness as its peculiar territory. It evokes not only geographical terrain, but also an inner landscape, an &#x201c;inscape,&#x201d; as it were&#x2014;a world of imaginative being.<br> &nbsp;<br> Between Egypt and the Holy Land, the wilderness intervenes. As the Torah tells the story, this was meant to form a brief episode in the history of the Israelites, a passage between leaving Egypt&#x2014;<i>yetziat Mitzraim</i>&#x2014;and entering the Land. But the brief interlude suddenly and tragically swells to deathly proportions. In one traumatic moment, the divine decree goes forth: this interval will encompass the life and death of a whole generation. Those who left Egypt will sink into the sands of this wilderness. Only their children will see the Land.<br> &nbsp;<br> What is the nature of this interim space, so terribly extended? The surface of the wilderness proves to hold vertical menace&#x2014;&#x201c;Into this wilderness your carcasses shall fall!&#x201d; the Torah intones repeatedly. This is not simply a walking surface for the traveling people, but a quicksand ready to consume human bodies. The first such bodies figure in the macabre showdown of Korach&#x2019;s rebellion, where the earth &#x201c;opens its mouth and swallows&#x201d; Korach&#x2019;s followers. They &#x201c;vanish&#x201d; from the human landscape, into the netherworld: the hungry maw of the earth has removed them from the surface on which human acts are played out. Nothingness has triumphed over being.<br> &nbsp;<br> This terrible image haunts the reader, who contemplates the many vanishings of a whole generation. For this is the very nature of the <i>midbar</i>&#x2014;of <i>this great and terrible wilderness</i>. It is an environment that is inimical to human life. Jeremiah describes its singular horror when he reminds the people: &#x201c;God has led you through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought and deadly darkness, through a land that no man passed and where no man dwelt&#x201d; (Jer. 2:6).<br> &nbsp;<br> This landscape does not yield to human demands: it frustrates the need for food and drink, but also the basic demand for direction, for markings to indicate a human mapping of blank space. No human steps have trod this sand, it stares back at the traveler indifferently&#x2014;pathless, <i>bewildering </i>to the human imagination. A kind of horror besets the mind. Already traumatized by their Egyptian past, the Israelites, one by one, must be swallowed into this senseless space.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A great and terrible wilderness&#x201d;: the experience of <i>midbar, </i>extended to the edges of life, suddenly becomes a total experience. These people will never know any other reality. But precisely here lies the central enigma of the narrative. For in its way of telling the story, the Torah creates an illusion of continuity, as though we are throughout reading about the same people who left Egypt. Till the second census in chapter 26, the reader does not clearly understand that thirty-eight years have passed, with their full harvest of death. Only when the text clearly states that in this census there are no survivors from the earlier census at the beginning of the book (26:64), do we realize that, without our noticing, a generation has slipped into the sands. A great interruption has occurred; thirty-eight years have imperceptibly vanished. By chapter 20, in fact, the new generation is already in place. And yet, even then, even after the census and indeed throughout Deuteronomy, it takes an effort to convince ourselves that, in fact, the generations have changed.<br> &nbsp;<br> At the heart of the wilderness story, then, there is a gap, which is masked by apparent continuities. As often in traumatic experience, the rupture is somehow elided from the official record. The record continues to register the human hubbub of complaint and rebellion to which we have become accustomed. But the fabric of national life has been ripped open; unremarked within that hubbub, ring the death cries and the sudden silence of a generation.<br> &nbsp;<br> This macabre secret at the heart of the narrative is revealed only after the catastrophe is over. It becomes one of the central &#x201c;bewilderments&#x201d; of the book. The other &#x201c;bewilderment&#x201d;&#x2014;also essential to this wilderness&#x2014;is the lack of <i>emunah, </i>of <i>faith, </i>that continuously and repeatedly characterizes the people&#x2019;s utterances. Classic midrashic sources have suggested that <i>midbar </i>is closely associated with issues of <i>dibbur, </i>of language and utterance. <i>Ein midbar ela dibbur, </i>declares one such source&#x2014;&#x201c;Wilderness is nothing but utterance&#x201d;&#x2014;cryptically playing with the roots for the two terms. In which case, we can say that the Book of the Wilderness yields a human language of querulous skepticism. Cries and whispers and rages and laments fill the air, a cacophony that God describes as issuing from lack of faith.<br> &nbsp;<br> At the beginning of the Exodus narrative, Moses protests against his mission of redemption: &#x201c;But they will not believe me, they will not listen to my voice! They will say, God did not appear to you!&#x201d; (Exod. 4:1). Moses&#x2019; basic sense of the people is that they are <i>un-believing</i>. His words will fall on deaf ears; he has no power to impinge on their skepticism, which, in his mind, is radical, subversive of redemptive possibility.<br> &nbsp;<br> God, too, protests at this recalcitrant trait in the Israelite character: &#x201c;How long will they have no faith in Me, despite all the signs I have enacted in their midst?&#x201d; (Num. 14:11). Not-believing and having no faith are different nuances of a fundamental posture indicated by the Hebrew word <i>emunah</i>. This connotes solidity, stability, con�tinuity, validity. God sees the people as <i>not-trusting</i>. In spite of all the signs, all the indications of His love and His benign purpose, His promise to bring them into the Land is, it seems, deeply <i>incredible </i>to them. &#x201c;<i>Ad anna? </i>How long?&#x201d; God asks: How inherently unstable is this condition of <i>no-faith, no-trust</i>!<br> &nbsp;<br> The posture of <i>not trusting, </i>ironically, seems to affect Moses also. In the end, God will accuse him of &#x201c;having no faith in Me, to sanctify Me before the eyes of the Israelites&#x201d; (Num. 20:12). An epidemic of skepticism has apparently not spared Moses himself, whom God, at an earlier moment, had praised as uniquely <i>ne&#x2019;eman</i>&#x2014;&#x201c;<i>faithful </i>in all My household&#x201d; (12:7). <br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b><i>Skepticisms</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> Strangely, the wilderness seems to bring out latent skepticisms, even in those who are also capable of moments of trust and faith. This same people, after all, did believe Moses&#x2019; original message, as God had promised they would. The &#x201c;signs&#x201d;&#x2014;the leprous hand of Moses, his staff that changes into a snake&#x2014;do their work. And at the Red Sea, the Israelites do see God&#x2019;s mighty hand and &#x201c;believe in God and in His servant, Moses&#x201d; (Exod. 14:31). But this was before the Book of the Wilderness, in another world. In the wilderness space of bewilderment, their language expresses a &#x201c;desert-sea&#x201d; of skepticism, as the American philosopher Stanley Cavell, in a different context, describes this state of being.<br> &nbsp;<br> For Cavell, modern skepticism is to be viewed against the history of an age-old philosophical posture that came to dominate European philosophy and literature from Descartes onward. As a philosophical position, skepticism questions our ability to know the world and its objects, including other minds. But, he adds: &#x201c;skepticism with respect to the other is not skepticism but is tragedy.&#x201d; It is a moral stance &#x201c;in the face of the other&#x2019;s opacity and the demand the other&#x2019;s expression places upon me; I call skepticism my denial or annihilation of the other.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Cavell&#x2019;s descriptions of this moral posture are informed by psychoanalytic thought: it represents &#x201c;world-consuming doubt, which is hence a standing threat to . . . human existence&#x201d;; an &#x201c;unappeasable denial, a wishful uncertainty that constitutes an annihilation&#x201d;; an &#x201c;incurable malady.&#x201d; Cavell traces the devastations of this malady through Shakespeare&#x2019;s <i>The Winter&#x2019;s Tale</i>&#x2014;where a king refuses to acknowledge his own son&#x2014;and through Kant&#x2019;s <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i>. It is a fanaticism, nihilism, that no knowing can oppose. At its heart, it wants &#x201c;there to be nothing,&#x201d; if there can&#x2019;t be everything. Its basic question is &#x201c;How can I trust the basis upon which I grant the existence of the other?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The response that Cavell offers is drawn from Levinas: &#x201c;To see a face is already to hear &#x2018;You shall not kill.&#x2019; &#x201d; If for Kant the scandal of philosophy is that &#x201c;the existence of things outside us . . . should have to be assumed merely on faith,&#x201d; then for Cavell &#x201c;the problem is to <i>recognize </i>myself as denying another. . . . Here is the scandal of skepticism with respect to the existence of others; <i>I am the scandal</i>&#x201d; (my emphasis).<br> &nbsp;<br> In the wilderness history of the Israelites, this scandal is most acutely expressed in the narrative of the Spies, who, with one word&#x2014;<i>efes, </i>zero&#x2014;obliterate their own faithful report of the &#x201c;goodness&#x201d; of the Land. <i>Efes, </i>usually translated &#x201c;however,&#x201d; deletes at one stroke the beauty of the world and of God&#x2019;s promise. In Cavell&#x2019;s terms, it rep�resents a failure of <i>acknowledgment</i>&#x2014;perhaps even a wish for there to be nothing: not to be born, not to love or marry or acknowledge one&#x2019;s own son. In the absence of certainty, a core fantasy of disappointment dissolves the possibility of even partial knowledge. The only alternative to this fantasy of annihilation is accepting that the world and its people are separate from us, &#x201c;as if gone,&#x201d; and &#x201c;must be regained every day.&#x201d; Repeated mourning of this kind is the &#x201c;condition of the possibility of accepting the world&#x2019;s beauty.&#x201d;<br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> <b><i>The Double Narrative</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> Cavell&#x2019;s complex view of skepticism frames it as a malady that is also a liberation from dogmatism. In the biblical narrative, the questions that the Spies are commissioned to investigate begin with the radical question <i>Mah hi?: </i>&#x201c;You shall see the Land. . . . <i>What is it?</i>&#x201d; And again, &#x201c;<i>What is </i>the Land? . . . Is it good or evil? . . . <i>What </i>are the cities? <i>What is the Land? </i>Is it fertile or infertile?&#x201d; (Num. 13:18&#x2013;20). The repeated <i>Mah?</i>&#x2014;the &#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; question&#x2014;expresses a necessity of the human mind: to question, to see, to articulate meanings. The Spies&#x2019; mission, is, in a sense, to be <i>skeptical, </i>not to rely on hearsay, or even on God&#x2019;s original magisterial description of the Land: &#x201c;a good and spacious Land, flowing with milk and honey&#x201d; (Exod. 3:8). God Himself, after all, initiated the Spies&#x2019; mission. This fact seems to validate a &#x201c;good&#x201d; skepticism, the inquiring spirit of those who want to know for themselves what can be known.<br> &nbsp;<br> However, it seems that &#x201c;good&#x201d; and &#x201c;bad&#x201d; skepticisms may be expressed in the same words. The midrash offers the analogy of a king who makes an excellent match for his son, only to have his son demand to see the bride for himself. The king is aggrieved at his son&#x2019;s doubting his word: &#x201c;Because you did not trust me, you will never see her in your home&#x2014;she will marry your son!&#x201d; The prince wants to &#x201c;see&#x201d; the bride in order to ascertain her beauty. Is he justified in wanting to find out what only he can know&#x2014;if she is beautiful <i>in his eyes</i>? Or is the father right to be aggrieved at his son&#x2019;s lack of trust?<br> &nbsp;<br> Perhaps both positions are valid. In &#x201c;real time,&#x201d; in Numbers 13:2, it seems that God underwrites the Spies&#x2019; mission; but forty years later, Moses retells the story in such a way as to incriminate the people for initiating the project. &#x201c;I told them it is a good land,&#x201d; God pro�tests in Rashi&#x2019;s reading of the story. But the goodness of the Land is ultimately a subjective matter, to be acknowledged, if at all, by the people who are to &#x201c;marry&#x201d; it. Is the bridegroom simply exercising the right of an adult to choose a lovable bride? Or is he moved by a nihilism that may reject the very possibility of love?<br> &nbsp;<br> The double biblical narrative, as well as the midrashic parable, put on view the ambiguity of the issue of trust. This issue, with all its bewilderments, runs through the book of Numbers. The treachery of the Sotah, the woman suspected of adultery, is itself the subject of an uncertainty that the ordeal is to resolve. Is she guilty or innocent? <i>What is she? </i>But, it turns out, no absolute certainty is to be had. In human affairs, the field of inquiry is never sterile; the wife may have other virtues that cloud the issue, or the husband may have a history of his own that will similarly block the elegance of the proof. If she is innocent, an incomplete certainty frees her from suspicion. If she is guilty, she may confess, and thus avoid the (dis)solution of God&#x2019;s Name in the bitter waters.

He afflicted you and subjected you to hunger and gave you manna to eat, which neither you nor your fathers had ever known, in order that you might know that man does not live on bread alone, but that man may live on whatever issues from God&#x2019;s mouth</i>. (Deut. 8:2&#x2013;3)<br> &nbsp;<br> The forty-year <i>midbar </i>journey was intended as a difficult odys�sey of self-understanding, a reconnaissance mission into the human heart. The manna is essential wilderness food, unknown, uncanny; but precisely in its unknowability it will open a new kind of knowledge: &#x201c;that man does not live on bread alone but on what issues from God&#x2019;s mouth.&#x201d; The sentence communicates the mystery of the manna: it stirs up the question&#x2014;<i>What is it </i>that can sustain human life?<br> &nbsp;<br> For manna is both bread and not-bread; it comes, not from the earth but from heaven, from God&#x2019;s mouth, like His utterances and the world they create. The manna is an intimate encounter with the otherness that issues from God&#x2019;s mouth. ...</p><h2>JJ Virgin&#39;s Sugar Impact Diet Cookbook: 150 Low-Sugar Recipes to Help You Lose Up to 10 Pounds in Just 2 Weeks</h2><p><b>The Essential Companion to <i>JJ Virgin's Sugar Impact Diet</i></b> <br><i>JJ Virgin's Sugar Impact Diet</i> will revolutionize the way readers think about sugar.

Like so many driven and talented women who have been brought up to believe that to have it all, they must do it all, Dufu began to feel that achieving her career and personal goals was an impossibility. Eventually, she discovered the solution: letting go. In <i>Drop the Ball</i>, Dufu recounts how she learned to reevaluate expectations, shrink her to-do list, and meaningfully engage the assistance of others&#x2015;freeing the space she needed to flourish at work and to develop deeper, more meaningful relationships at home. </p><p> Even though women are half the workforce, they still represent only eighteen per cent of the highest level leaders. The reasons are obvious: just as women reach middle management they are also starting families. Mounting responsibilities at work and home leave them with no bandwidth to do what will most lead to their success. Offering new perspective on why the women&#x2019;s leadership movement has stalled, and packed with actionable advice, Tiffany Dufu&#x2019;s <i>Drop the Ball</i> urges women to embrace imperfection, to expect less of themselves and more from others&#x2015;only then can they focus on what they truly care about, devote the necessary energy to achieving their real goals, and create the type of rich, rewarding life we all desire.</p></p><p>Named to <i>Fast Company&#x2019;s</i> League of Extraordinary Women, Tiffany Dufu was a launch team member to Lean In and is Chief Leadership Officer to Levo, the fastest growing millennial professional network.

Author of <i>Drop the Ball: Achieving More by Doing Less,</i> she lives in New York City with her husband and two children.<p>"There are two ways that a system of power stays in power. The first is obvious--unequal laws, unequal opportunity, very unequal money, and violence or the threat of violence--the second is more internal and difficult to uproot. Tiffany Dufu's <i>Drop the Ball </i>is crucial because it takes on that deeper system. She is the right author for this important moment in time. She offers actionable wisdom to pass from one woman to another, from her family to yours. She not only shows that we all gain when women become part of, contribute our talents to, and are ourselves changed by the world <i>outside </i>the home, but also how we will gain when men become part of, contribute their talents to, and are themselves changed by the world inside the home.

In 1962 MacDonald was named a Grand Master of the Mystery Writers of America; in 1980, he won a National Book Award. In print he delighted in smashing the bad guys, deflating the pompous, and exposing the venal. In life, he was a truly empathetic man; his friends, family, and colleagues found him to be loyal, generous, and practical. In business, he was fastidiously ethical. About being a writer, he once expressed with gleeful astonishment, &#x201c;They pay me to do this!

She suddenly remembered it was Sunday, market day. Glancing out the window, she saw broad daylight. "What's the matter with me! It's late!" she exclaimed. She dressed hurriedly, splashed water over her fingertips, ran through her morning prayers, grabbed her basket, and sped off to the market, afraid she would miss all the bargains.</p> <p>It was a beautiful morning. A warm sun bathed Holeneshti in its golden rays. Once she reached the market, Leah was like a fish in water&#x2014;she was in her element. The sheer size of the Holeneshti market was something to behold. The Moldavian peasants had brought in sheep's milk and cheese, and great quantities of vegetables from their gardens&#x2014;corn, greens, and cucumbers, all selling for a song, as well as onions, garlic, and bitter herbs. With all these plentiful choices before her, Leah quickly negotiated a basketful. And the fish! A heaven-sent bargain! She had not planned to buy fish, but suddenly there they were. But please imagine what fish&#x2014;tiny, skinny, scrawny little things, all bone, barely a mouthful, but so cheap it would be a shame to turn them down. No one would believe it! Yes, Leah, was having a lucky day at the market. Of the one ruble she had brought, quite a bit was still left. With so much still unspent, she thought she would surprise the cantor with a gift&#x2014;ten fresh eggs. <i>Yisroyeli will appreciate that,</i> she thought. It would be enough to make ten throat-soothing honey <i>gogl-mogls</i>. The High Holidays would be here soon&#x2014;<i>He'll need them to keep his throat in good shape. And how about candies for my Reizel? She loves sweets, confections, snacks</i>&#x2014;<i>bless her, what a delight that girl is. I only wish I could buy her new shoes. The old ones are worn through and through</i>&#x2014;<i>useless.</i></p> <p>With these thoughts spurring her on the cantor's wife hurried from booth to booth until the rest of the ruble had melted away like snow. Only then could she finally relax and go home.</p> <p>As she neared her house, she could hear the cantor practicing his prayers: "<i>Mee-ee-ee ba-a-esh u'mee-ee-ee bamayim!</i>" That sweet familiar voice had given her pleasure for so long, but she never tired of it. Yisroyeli the cantor was practicing a brand new <i>U'netaneh tokef</i> to chant for Rosh Hashanah. He was not one of your great cantors with a worldwide reputation, but in his own Holeneshti he was famous enough. You can be sure the town would never have exchanged him for the greatest cantor, not even one with his own choir, nor let him go for a million rubles! But that's neither here nor there. Yisroyeli the cantor also taught on the side&#x2014;without it the family would never have been able to manage. Luckily he was a fine biblical scholar with a talent for teaching Hebrew. In addition, God had blessed him with a fine hand to pen letters for those who could not write. He had ten students, the richest children in town. One of his prize pupils was the son of Benny Rafalovitch, the richest man in town. Two incomes are nothing to sneeze at. Nonetheless, despite his chanting and his teaching, he and Leah often did not have enough to eat for <i>Shabbes</i>. Still, they would not die of hunger&#x2014;somehow they would find a way.</p> <p>Arriving home, carrying a full basket from the market, perspiring, Leah was surprised to find that her daughter did not show her face. Usually Reizel, was already dressed and washed, her hair combed, running to greet her. She'd poke around in her basket: "Mama, what did you bring me?" "Wait a minute," Leah would say, "what's the hurry? First let me get your father his glass of chicory."</p> <p>That was what the cantor's wife was expecting today. But the house was quiet, strangely quiet. Reizel was nowhere to be seen or heard though the door was open. Was it possible she was still asleep? The cantor continued to warble, reaching the highest notes with a sob, "Ach, <i>mee-ee-ee ba-eysh umee-ee-ee bamayim!</i>" And again, "<i>Mee-ee-ee ba-a-esh umee-ee-ee bamayim.</i>"</p> <p>Quietly, Leah tiptoed into the house and set the basket down in a corner. So as not to disturb her husband in his work, she busied herself at the stove, all the while muttering: "God in heaven! Is she still asleep? These young girls! The students are coming to class any minute now, and she'll be walking around half-naked right in front of them. She thinks she's still a child.</p> <p>"Yisroyeli! Yisroyeli? No, he can't hear me. He's too wrapped up in his <i>ba-eyshes</i> and <i>bamayims</i> prayers this morning. God help us! Someone might think they're stuffing his pockets with gold for his chanting. And here Reizel walks around in worn-out shoes, may I suffer her pains. How long is she going to sleep! I have to wake the child up!"</p> <p>With these words, Leah hurried to the curtain that divided the room and listening quietly for a moment. Then she slowly lifted the curtain with two fingers. She peered in the bed, looked toward the open window&#x2014;and froze, unable to speak. Feeling as if someone had struck her heart with a stone, she turned to her husband:</p> <p>"Yisroyeli!"</p> <p>The intensity of her voice immediately stopped Yisroyeli's singing. "What is it, Leah?"</p> <p>"Where is Reizel?"</p> <p>"What do you mean, where is Reizel? Isn't she asleep?"</p> <p>***</p> <p>Within half an hour the news had spread through the town about the cantor's misfortune. People streamed into the house to find out what had happened. "Is she really gone? How is this possible? How could this have happened?"</p> <p>For the rest of the morning the town seethed like a kettle: "Have you heard? The cantor's daughter is gone!" "What do you mean? Where has she gone? "Gone&#x2014;as if she had sunk into the earth."</p> <p>And the cantor? How to describe him? He neither cried nor spoke. He stood in the middle of the room like a statue, staring at the empty bed mutely, as if words and even reason itself had failed him. His wife, however, was tearing around the town like a mad woman, wringing her hands, and beating herself in the head, crying out to the heavens, "My daughter! My child! My precious!" Trooping after her, the townspeople helped her search. They hunted everywhere, in every corner&#x2014;across the bridge, in the cemetery, in all the Wallachian gardens, and even in the lake. Gone!</p> <p>Half dead, the cantor's wife was carried home to a house full of people, all talking about the tragedy that had befallen the cantor in his own home. Some pulled back the curtain to gaze at the empty bed and the open window. "So it was from here the bird flew away?" they wondered. Leave it to the people of Holeneshti to come up with a clever way of putting it.</p> <p><b>Chapter 2</b></p> <p><b>She Faints Away</b></p> <p>Every Jewish town, no matter how poor, must have its own Rothschild. The Rothschild of Holeneshti was Benny Rafalovitch. To tell you all about his wealth and position would be too much. It will suffice simply to describe how many sat at his table. Each and every day at Benny's table you would find no fewer than twenty people: sons, daughters, sons-in-law, daughters-in-law. All were handsome, healthy, well-fed souls with full round faces. Among them was also an old grandmother whose head shook from side to side, as if saying, "No no!"; a nursemaid, pale as an underdone roll but with a flush high on her cheeks; and a young man, a distant relative, who oversaw the household accounts. This young man's name was Simcha but everyone called him Sison v'Simcha, which means "joy and gladness." Not that he was such a happy creature&#x2014;on the contrary, he was by nature a cheerless, melancholy sort with a sleepy demeanor. He had black, shiny hair, puffy eyes, and a constantly stuffed nose that made it difficult for him to properly pronounce his <i>m</i>'s and <i>n</i>'s, and his full and thickly mustached upper lip didn't help.</p> <p>We will have the opportunity to become acquainted with this family in due time, but in general we can say that theirs was a wealthy, happy, lively household that was most fond of eating. When it came time for them to eat, one could have gone deaf from the uproar, the din, the clatter of spoons and forks.</p> <p>At the head of the table, like a king, sat the master of the house himself, Benny, a Bessarabian Jew with a substantial belly and beard that grew horizontally. Yes, it parted to the left and to the right, not like an ordinary beard, and it refused to lie flat as it should. But he could do nothing about it, try as he might!</p> <p>When Benny ate, he threw himself into it&#x2014;nothing could distract him. He hated doing two things at once anyway, but when eating he refused to be bothered about anything else. He spoke very little but didn't mind when others spoke. When a clamor erupted at the table, he would shout, "Quiet down, you scamps! Better look into your prayer books and pay attention to what you are reciting!" By this he meant they should look into their plates and pay attention to what they were eating. It was his way to speak elliptically. For instance, he called a horse a "fellow," money was "shards," a wife was a "disaster," a son was a "kaddish," a daughter a "blister," bread a "thread," a house an "attic," an alcove a "hole,"&#x2014;an so on. One could have created a whole new dictionary from Benny Rafalovitch's vocabulary.</p> <p>At the opposite head of the table sat, Benny's wif...</p></p><h2>Dead of Night (Doc Ford)</h2><p>Asked to check on his friend&#39;s brother, a reclusive biologist who has not been answering his phone, Doc Ford interrupts a violent crime scene and finds himself embroiled in a deadly case involving eco-terrorism and personal revenge. By the author of Tampa Burn. 80,000 first printing.</p><p>Randy Wayne White is the author of seventeen previous Doc Ford novels and four collections of nonfiction. He lives in an old house built on an Indian mound in Pineland, Florida.The raspy voice of Dick Hill is the perfect match for this tense adventure. Marine biologist Marian Ford battles greedy land developers who are employing an eco-terrorist agenda for their own gain. Audie Award winner Hill portrays multiple characters with just the right mix of central Florida accent and world-weary tone. The story's twists and turns both entertain and, at one juncture, amaze, with a death scene that incorporates Ford's epiphany. Randy Wayne White, the author of TAMPA BURN, makes the science fascinating and makes us care about the characters involved in it. All told, DEAD OF NIGHT is more unsettling than the usual thriller.

He moved among the elite of New York society with little notice, his sharply cocked fedora, his broad Irish face and his ever-present cigar setting him apart from the celebrities and socialites.<br><br>Umbrella Mike is Michael Joseph Boyle, the corrupt leader of Chicago's most powerful union and himself a Chicago gangster on friendly terms with Al Capone. Passionate about high-class automobiles, Umbrella Mike was one of the few who could afford the luxury of racing during the hardship of the Depression. In 1937, dogged by adverse publicity and a barrage of disasters, the prestigious Vanderbilt Cup was held on Long Island.<br><br>Brock Yates &#x2014; noted editor, columnist and sports analyst and commentator &#x2014; remarkably chronicles the dramatic events that unfolded during this most controversial of races &#x2014; pitting against one another a Nazi poster child, a German-hating Swiss, and the brilliant American underdog who has a trick or two up his sleeve.<br></p><p>Brock Yates is editor-at-large and featured columnist for Car and Driver magazine, erstwhile CBS Sports analyst, and commentator for the Speedvision Motorsports Cable Network. He is the author of many works, including the screenplay for &#34;The Cannonball Run.&#34; He lives in upstate New York.Umbrella Mike, aka Michael Joseph Boyle--union official, friend of Al Capone, and auto-racing aficionado--is spiritedly limned in this Depression-era chronicle of a gangster's progress and the establishment of the Indianapolis 500 as the nation's preeminent auto race. Truly larger than life, Boyle got involved in the 1937 Vanderbilt Cup race, which introduced Nazism in motor sports. The Vanderbilt competition, which flourished 1904-16 and was revived in 1936 and 1937, attracted European as well as American drivers, thanks to a hefty prize purse. That auto racing got mixed up in the times' turbulent politics isn't surprising, but that Chicago gangsterism was part of the heady mix adds the brio that makes the book special. Until now, Boyle has been overlooked by students of the Chicago Outfit, and Yates does much to make amends. Needless to say, this is also a great book for auto-racing enthusiasts, an excellent shelf mate for Yates' pictorial study of the 1936 and 1937 Vanderbilt Cup events, <i>Vanderbilt Cup Race</i> (1997). <i>Mike Tribby</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

She lives in Washington, D.C.Anne Truitt is a sculptor, painter, mother, and grandmother. <b>Daybook</b>, her first published journal, is illuminating and nourishing: "It is as if there are external equivalents for truths which I already in some mysterious way know. In order to catch these equivalents, I have to stay 'turned on' all the time, to keep my receptivity to what is around me totally open. Preconception is fatal to this process. Vulnerability is implicitly in it; pain, inevitable." For Anne Truitt, art is life. While refusing "the inflated definition of artists as special people with special prerogatives and special excuses," she recognizes special difficulties and differences between artists and other professionals. The work of doctors and lawyers involves a clearly-defined practice, the skills needed by plumbers and carpenters are obvious. Artists however, must "spin their work out of themselves, discover its law, and then present themselves turned inside out to the public gaze." The mother of three children abandoned by a husband who never looked back, she is harried by everyday concerns: "I feel a little pulled at the seams. Too much is happening too fast for me to integrate. Life unrolls like a Mack Sennett comedy. The film is so speeded up that events threaten to splinter into nonsense." In a consistently tender and down-to-earth voice, Anne Truitt explores her life and work, gently guiding herself - and her fortunate readers - through a growing woman's life. <i>-- For great reviews of books for girls, check out Let's Hear It for the Girls: 375 Great Books for Readers 2-14</i>. -- <i>From 500 Great Books by Women; review by Jesse Larsen</i></p><h2>Abecedarian Book</h2><p>Abecedarian Book, The by Ferguson, Charles W.. 8vo. 1st ed.</p><p></p><h2>Tarot in the Spirit of Zen: The Game of Life</h2><p><p><b>One of the twentieth century&#x2019;s greatest spiritual teachers presents a unique and valuable resource for all students and practitioners of the Tarot.</b></p><p>A must have for owners of the phenomenally popular Osho Zen Tarot, this in-depth study of the meanings of the cards in the Osho Zen Tarot deck will also appeal to those who use the Rider, Crowley, and other, more traditional cards.

"Kroeger's biography of Nellie Bly moves at almost as fast a pace as did Bly's remarkable life."--Mindy Spatt, San Francisco Chronicle. Photos &amp; illustrations.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>She had herself committed to an insane asylum, circled the globe in 72 days, and worked as an elephant trainer, all for a good story. Nellie Bly (1864-1922) was the most famous female reporter of her day, and a pioneering businesswoman (she started the first steel-barrel manufacturing plant in the U.S.). Journalist Kroeger&#39;s formidably well-researched book, based on legal and archival material as well as Bly&#39;s more than 600 newspaper and magazine articles, paints a compelling portrait of a woman who learned early not to rely on men, yet coupled her can-do spirit with a vivacious femininity that endeared her to readers during a 37-year career.A meticulously researched, consistently entertaining biography of the legendary turn-of-the-century journalist whose true adventures far outstripped the boundaries of myth. For this first full-scale treatment of Bly, former United Press International reporter Kroeger reaches through a web of half- truths (many courtesy of the subject herself) and scanty facts to uncover the complex path of ``a life not so much lived as waged.'' Born near Pittsburgh in 1864, Elizabeth Jane Cochran began her career with an extraordinary stroke of luck--the editor of The Pittsburgh Dispatch, fascinated by her spirited letter rebuking a columnist who urged women to stay at home, gave the untrained 20- year-old a position and, in the fashion of the day, a catchy life- long pseudonym. But it was her own initiative that secured lasting fame. Deciding to scale the walls of newspaper capital New York, with her sights set on Joseph Pulitzer's splashy The World, Bly quickly became a leading investigative reporter in a business still largely closed to women. National celebrity came with an effort to better Jules Verne's fictional Phileas Fogg by going around the world in 75 days. Her relentlessly self-referential but charming and uninhibited style made Bly, in Kroeger's estimation, perhaps the first ``gonzo'' journalist. Reborn as an enlightened manufacturer after a curious elopement with a millionaire industrialist 40 years her senior, Bly mastered technology sufficiently to pick up 25 patents in her own name. Financial ruin drew the now-widowed Bly to Austria to report from the front lines of WW I, and a final foray into New York journalism, just prior to her death at 57, cast Bly as a passionate advocate for downtrodden women and children. While skillfully conveying the outlines of an astounding life, Kroeger, hampered by a lack of intimate detail, never manages to make Bly a fully three-dimensional character- -although, as she amply demonstrates, four or five dimensions would seem more appropriate. Inspiring reading for those searching out a feminist role model--or just a breathless ride through an incredible life.

And the long wraparound porch where I&#x2019;d spent lazy summer days cuddled up with a good book and glass after glass of pink lemonade.</p><p>Of course, all of that was before my mother died. Before all the joy went right out of my life and right out of that house.</p><p>Looking up at the dark redbrick manor with black shutters and a gleaming white porch, I could see that not much had changed about the house in thirty years. It still looked as grand, charming, and pristine as ever, but inside I could feel the ghosts that haunted the old Southern home. Literally.</p><p>&#x201c;Are we there yet?&#x201d; Gil yawned from the backseat. Gilley is my BFF. He&#x2019;s been my best friend for over twenty years, so he knows my history well.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re here,&#x201d; Heath said, arching his back and stretching. It&#x2019;d been a long drive from Boston to the southern Georgia city of Valdosta. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know this place was gonna be so . . . big.&#x201d;</p><p>Gil sat up and leaned forward. &#x201c;M.J. didn&#x2019;t tell you?&#x201d; he asked, like I wasn&#x2019;t in the van. &#x201c;Her daddy&#x2019;s a very wealthy man.&#x201d;</p><p>I scowled. Gil made it sound like that was something to be proud of. But since my mother&#x2019;s death, Daddy had always put his work before me, so I hardly thought it a positive thing. Plus, he&#x2019;d never once offered to help me out in all those years Gil and I had struggled to make ends meet in Boston.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, he&#x2019;d have to be to afford this place,&#x201d; Heath said. My gaze shifted to him. He looked intimidated, and I thought I knew why. Heath came from far humbler&#x2014;but perhaps more honorable&#x2014;circumstances.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; I said, reaching for his hand. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s his money, not mine.&#x201d;</p><p>Heath tore his eyes away from the house. &#x201c;Yeah, but, Em, I mean . . . look at this place.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just a house,&#x201d; I said, leaning in to give him a quick peck before getting out of the van.</p><p>As we walked from the van toward the house, the front porch door opened and out stepped Daddy. My breath caught in surprise at the sight of him. I barely recognized the man standing there.</p><p>My father had always been a tall and imposing figure. Well over six feet, he&#x2019;d been a big barrel of a man who&#x2019;d gone gray, then silver prematurely, and whose countenance had always appeared to be tired and overworked. The man on the porch, whom I hadn&#x2019;t seen in several years, was still tall and imposing, but he&#x2019;d trimmed down by at least forty pounds&#x2014;pounds he&#x2019;d always carried around his middle and which he really had needed to lose. His hair was also darker, but it suited him and made him look ten years younger, and his face, always set in a deep frown, was actually lifted into an expression I hadn&#x2019;t seen him wear since I was ten. The man actually looked happy.</p><p>&#x201c;You okay?&#x201d; Heath whispered, and I realized he&#x2019;d taken up my hand.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; I said, shaking my head a little. &#x201c;He just looks . . .&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Amazing,&#x201d; Gil said on the other side of me. &#x201c;Lord, M.J., is that really Montgomery Holliday?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hey there, Mary Jane,&#x201d; my father called from the porch with a wave. &#x201c;I was expectin&#x2019; you a little later. Y&#x2019;all must&#x2019;ve made good time.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, Daddy,&#x201d; I replied as we started up the walk toward the stairs. &#x201c;We did make good time.&#x201d;</p><p>My father nodded and adopted something halfway between a grimace and a smile, but I couldn&#x2019;t really fault him for it. If you don&#x2019;t ever smile even once in twenty years, I expect you&#x2019;d be out of practice.</p><p>The porch door opened again and out stepped a lovely-looking woman perhaps in her late fifties or early sixties. She had a regal quality about her with short-cropped and perfectly coiffed blond hair, bright blue eyes, and a trim figure. Her smile was brilliant and contagious and she clapped her hands at the sight of us. &#x201c;Ooo!&#x201d; she exclaimed. &#x201c;Monty, is this your daughter?&#x201d;</p><p>I had climbed the steps and now stood in front of Daddy and the woman who must be his new fianc�e, Christine Bigelow. &#x201c;This is her, dear,&#x201d; Daddy said, stepping forward to open up his arms to me.</p><p>For a moment I just stood there confused. Daddy hadn&#x2019;t hugged me since the day my mother died. In fact, that was perhaps the last time he&#x2019;d ever touched me tenderly, so this open display of affection was throwing me a little and I didn&#x2019;t know how to react.</p><p>Next to me I heard Gil clear his throat, then push me with his hand a little, and I sort of took two awkward steps forward and Daddy hugged me with three neat pats to the back before letting go. He continued to wear that strange half smile, half grimace.</p><p>And then I was wrapped up in another hug from Christine. She squeezed me tight and added another &#x201c;Ooo!&#x201d; Then she stepped back and held me at arm&#x2019;s length. &#x201c;Mary Jane, I have heard so many wonderful things about you! Your father simply raves about how smart and amazing his little girl is!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You have?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;He does?&#x201d; I wasn&#x2019;t trying to be a brat&#x2014;I was actually really surprised that Daddy would say anything even remotely kind on my behalf. He&#x2019;d spent decades letting everyone else know what a disappointment I was to him.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, of course!&#x201d; she said, and then her bright eyes turned to the two men at my side. &#x201c;Now, don&#x2019;t tell me. Let me guess,&#x201d; she said to them. Pointing to Heath, she said, &#x201c;You must be Heath Whitefeather, Mary Jane&#x2019;s boyfriend, and you,&#x201d; she said next, pointing to Gil, &#x201c;must be Gilley Gillespie, Mary Jane&#x2019;s best friend&#x2014;am I right?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What gave it away?&#x201d; Gil said, and I wanted to roll my eyes. Gilley was actually wearing mascara and blush today, along with blue nail polish. He loved flaunting his flamboyant side in my conservative Southern Baptist father&#x2019;s face.</p><p>&#x201c;Your mama described her handsome son to a T,&#x201d; Christine told him slyly. The tactic worked; Gil blushed and I knew she&#x2019;d just claimed another ally.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s very nice to meet you, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; Heath said, extending his hand to her.</p><p>Christine laughed lightly and shook her head, stepping forward to hug Heath. &#x201c;Oh, none of that formal stuff for family!&#x201d; she said.</p><p>I hate to admit it, but the lovely warmth and charm of the woman had an effect on me. I liked her. A lot. And I couldn&#x2019;t understand what she&#x2019;d first seen in my father, but looking at the dramatic change in him, I had to be grateful, because it was a world of difference.</p><p>Once she&#x2019;d had her fill of hugs, Christine took up my arm and Gilley&#x2019;s and said, &#x201c;Now! Let&#x2019;s all step inside and have ourselves a proper lunch, shall we?&#x201d;</p><p>We began to follow her and Daddy inside when a pickup truck came barreling up the drive at an alarming rate of speed, honking its horn to get our attention. Daddy&#x2019;s posture and countenance changed in a second and he stepped forward to the edge of the porch, ready to handle whatever came next.</p><p>Heath moved over to stand next to Daddy, and I could tell that my father approved of the move and perhaps even of Heath in that moment. The truck came to a stop and out jumped a man in jeans, a plaid shirt, a stained cowboy hat, and work boots. &#x201c;Mrs. Bigelow!&#x201d; he called urgently.</p><p>&#x201c;Clay,&#x201d; my father said, his voice full of the authority that used to send me scurrying.</p><p>Clay removed his hat and nodded to my father. He looked out of breath. &#x201c;Mr. Holliday, sorry to trouble you, but we&#x2019;ve had another situation at the work site.&#x201d;</p><p>Daddy moved down two steps toward Clay, and Heath followed him. Next to me Christine stood rigid, biting her lip as if she knew the news was bad.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s another accident,&#x201d; Clay said.</p><p>&#x201c;What happened?&#x201d; Daddy demanded.</p><p>&#x201c;The scaffolding in the ballroom gave way, sir. Two of my men were sent to the hospital.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, no!&#x201d; Christine exclaimed. &#x201c;Clay, are they badly injured?&#x201d;</p><p>Clay clenched and unclenched his hat. &#x201c;Not real bad, ma&#x2019;am, but bad enough. Boone&#x2019;s got a busted ankle, and Darryl might have a broken arm.&#x201d;</p><p>Christine&#x2019;s posture relaxed a fraction. &#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s dreadful,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m so grateful it wasn&#x2019;t worse! Monty, after lunch we should go straight to the hospital to see the men. And of course I&#x2019;ll cover their medical expenses.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Now just hold on here,&#x201d; my father interjected. &#x201c;Clay, that scaffolding is your responsibility. If it wasn&#x2019;t properly put together, Christine ain&#x2019;t gonna be responsible for no medical expenses.&#x201d;</p><p>It was Clay&#x2019;s turn to stiffen. &#x201c;Mr. Holliday, sir, that scaffolding was put together correctly. Why, I checked it myself this morning. Just like I checked all the other equipment and rigging that&#x2019;s somehow managed to come apart, or blow up, or fail on us and cause nothing but accidents at this jobsite. It ain&#x2019;t us, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, then who&#x2019;s responsible?&#x201d; Daddy snapped.</p><p>Clay fiddled with his hat and looked at the ground. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s like I told you last time, Mrs. Bigelow,&#x201d; he said, avoiding my father&#x2019;s sharp gaze. &#x201c;We think your place is cursed, and, ma&#x2019;am, I truly am sorry, but I&#x2019;m pulling my crew.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re what?&#x201d; Daddy roared loud enough for Clay to jump.</p><p>But the foreman wasn&#x2019;t backing down. Donning his hat, he looked directly at Christine and said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m real sorry, ma&#x2019;am. But that estate has something bad creeping through those hallways. I&#x2019;ve tried to tell you that I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s a good idea to keep messing with it, and maybe you&#x2019;d best to cut your losses too, before you or someone you love gets hurt same as my men. Anyway, we&#x2019;re leaving. I just wanted to come tell you in person, is all.&#x201d;</p><p>With that, he turned and headed back to his truck, even though Daddy called after him to come back and talk about it.</p><p>As Clay&#x2019;s pickup drove away, I turned to look at Christine. She looked stricken.</p><p>I knew from the gossip mill that Daddy&#x2019;s new fianc�e&#x2014;a wealthy widow originally from Florida&#x2014;was also fairly new to our small city. She&#x2019;d told folks here that she had come on a retreat to Valdosta with her then-ailing husband a few years back and had fallen in love with the place. After Mr. Bigelow&#x2019;s death, she&#x2019;d sold her home in Naples, which was also rumored to have been a sizably valuable property on the water, and she&#x2019;d set her sights on the estate of what had once been a prominent family here, the Porters of Valdosta.</p><p>The Porters had made their money in tobacco, but as smoking declined beginning in the late 1970s, so had the family&#x2019;s wealth. Through mismanagement and family greed, much of the once vast fortune had been squandered, and many of the two dozen or so Porter family members had fled Valdosta in shame.</p><p>Only one group of Porters had stayed in the area after 1985 to keep up appearances and inhabit the once proud estate, but I&#x2019;d heard that the mansion had fallen into disrepair of late, ever since the only two remaining Porter family members&#x2014;a brother and sister&#x2014;had moved out in the early 2000s. Still, no one had ever expected the remaining Porters to put their family&#x2019;s estate up for sale&#x2014;the house came with over three dozen acres of gorgeous woodlands, and I think everyone in town thought that either the brother or the sister would eventually start a family and move back in, but the years went by and that never came to pass. And then there were rumors of the heavy tax burden that the Porter estate carried, and ultimately, that, and the fact that neither sibling seemed interested in moving back home, could have been the motivation for the sale.</p><p>Whatever it was, the house and its surrounding land had been put on the market, and Christine had promptly jumped on it. I&#x2019;d been told that&#x2019;s how she&#x2019;d met Daddy, in fact. She&#x2019;d hired him to handle the transaction, and he&#x2019;d asked her out to coffee after she&#x2019;d signed the closing documents. Gilley&#x2019;s mom had said that they&#x2019;d been inseparable ever since.</p><p>Still, Mrs. Gillespie also said that the Porter house needed to be gutted and completely renovated, which made me wonder if Christine had known what she was really in for when she&#x2019;d purchased the place. And now there seemed to be a troublesome ghost in residence as well.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the third contractor to quit on us in as many months, Monty,&#x201d; Christine said, her voice holding a slight note of panic.</p><p>Daddy turned and came back up the steps, reaching out for her hand, which was still looped with mine. &#x201c;Now, now, Christy, don&#x2019;t you worry. We&#x2019;ll find another, better contractor. As I recall, you had half a dozen contractors bid on Porter Manor. After lunch I&#x2019;ll look at the list and pick the contractor with the most experience. Someone who won&#x2019;t be using any rickety scaffolding, unskilled labor, or poorly kept tools.&#x201d;</p><p>I could see that Christine&#x2019;s eyes were beginning to water, and she blinked rapidly to fight the tears. &#x201c;But what if Clay&#x2019;s right?&#x201d; she whispered. &#x201c;Monty, what if there really is something in that old place causing all those accidents?&#x201d;</p><p>Daddy adopted a patient look, but I could see he didn&#x2019;t believe a word of it. That didn&#x2019;t surprise me&#x2014;even though I&#x2019;d shown him enough evidence through the years to convince most anybody, Daddy never admitted that he believed in ghosts. &#x201c;Bah,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Christy, Clay&#x2019;s just covering his tracks, is all! He&#x2019;s trying to avoid gettin&#x2019; sued by his workers, honey. I&#x2019;ll bet money he or his crew didn&#x2019;t rig that scaffolding right, and it&#x2019;s his fault it fell down.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We could check it out,&#x201d; Heath said. &#x201c;M.J. and I could go over there and tell you for sure if there&#x2019;s a spook haunting the place.&#x201d;</p><p>My gaze cut to him and I shook my head subtly. But he was focused on Christine, who was obviously distressed. I knew he wanted to help, but he didn&#x2019;t know my father.</p><p>And just as I suspected, I saw Daddy&#x2019;s eyes narrow, and his lips compress into a disapproving scowl.</p><p>But Christine had already stepped forward and reached for Heath&#x2019;s hands. &#x201c;Oh, would you?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d be most grateful, Heath.&#x201d; Turning to me, she added, &#x201c;Most grateful to both of you!&#x201d;</p><p>I stood there dumbstruck, not really believing what&#x2019;d just happened. One minute we were headed in for a nice get-to-know-you lunch, and the next Heath was committing us to a ghostbust on our vacation. Which of course was just my luck.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;d be our pleasure,&#x201d; Heath assured her, nodding his head and smiling encouragingly at me.</p><p>&#x201c;Of . . . of course,&#x201d; I stammered. Christine clapped her hands happily, then hugged first Heath, then me and showered us with thank-yous.</p><p>Daddy cleared his throat, his irritation quelled but barely below the surface. And then Christine turned to him and said, &#x201c;Oh, Monty, your daughter and her beau are angels! I&#x2019;ll sleep well tonight knowing a pair of experts can put all this craziness to rest!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll go too,&#x201d; Gil offered, and Heath and I both widened our eyes. Gil seemed to realize what he&#x2019;d just committed himself to, because he followed that quickly with, &#x201c;You know. I&#x2019;ll monitor things from the van. Like usual.&#x201d;</p><p>Christine put her hand on his cheek and smiled sweetly. Gil, like Daddy, seemed to melt under her charms. &#x201c;Thank you, Gilley. That would be most kind of you.&#x201d; Gilley blushed and Heath and I hid smiles....</p></p><h2>I Am the Christian the Devil Warned You about</h2><p>&#34;I am the Christian the Devil Warned You About&#34; begins as a simple first person story in which a christian is miraculously transported to the very lair of Satan himself.

Until now, the vibrant flags of coastal Ghana have been treated largely as an "anthropological" phenomenon. While Adler and Barnard do not neglect the social function of these flags, the emphasis here is visual. The entire book is loaded with excellent full-color photographs that speak for themselves aesthetically. Fante society does not have a written language, and the tendency to use proverbs in speech is always reflected in flag imagery, making them powerful communication devices. Though the underlying meanings are pan-human, brief descriptions of the plates help transform exotic images into familiar concepts. An inexpensive, well-illustrated, accessible book.

It's up to Miss Julia to clear the air. <br><br> As if playing detective wasn't enough, Miss Julia still needs to show Sam that there's life left in their marital batteries-even if it means his are going to need some recharging.

A fine copy in a fine dust jacket. The Vampire Chronicles.</p><p>Time heals all wounds, unless, of course, you're a vampire. Cuts may heal, burns vanish, limbs reattach, but for the "blood god," the wounds of the heart sometimes stay open and raw for centuries. So it is for Marius, Anne Rice's oft-mentioned and beloved scholar. We've heard parts of his tale in past volumes of the Vampire Chronicles, but never so completely and never from his own lips. In <i>Blood and Gold</i>, Rice mostly (but not entirely) avoids the danger of treading worn ground as she fills out the life and character of Marius the Lonely, the Disenchanted, the Heartsick--a 2,000-year-old vampire "with all the conviction of a mortal man." <p> Plucked from his beloved Rome in the prime of his life and forced into solitude as keeper of the vampire queen and king, Marius has never forgiven the injustice of his mortal death. Thousands of years later, he still seethes over his losses. Immortality for Marius is both a blessing and a curse--he bears "witness to all splendid and beautiful things human," yet is unable to engage in relationships for fear of revealing his burden.</p><p> New readers to the Chronicles may wish for a more fleshed-out, less introspective hero, but Rice's legions of devoted fans will recognize <i>Blood and Gold</i> for what it is: a love song to Marius the Wanderer, whose story reveals the complexities and limitations of eternal existence. <i>--Daphne Durham</i></p>Chronicles continue with Anne Rice&#x2019;s spellbinding new novel, in which the great vampire Marius returns. <br><br>The golden-haired Marius, true Child of the Millennia, once mentor to The Vampire Lestat, always and forever the conscientious foe of the Evil Doer, reveals in his own intense yet inti-<br>mate voice the secrets of his two-thousand-year existence.<br><br>Once a proud Senator in Imperial Rome, kidnapped and made a &#x201c;blood god&#x201d; by the Druids, Marius becomes the embittered protector of Akasha and Enkil, Queen and King of the vampires, in whom the core of the supernatural race resides.<br><br>We follow him through his heartbreaking abandonment of the vampire Pandora.

Yet, very few realize the tremendous impact that taxation has had on civilization. The author changes that in this fascinating history.</p><p>The very word taxes sends shivers up spines. Yet, very few realize the tremendous impact that taxation has had on civilization. Charles Adams changes that in this fascinating history. Taxation, says Mr. Adams, has been a catalyst of history, the powerful influence if not the direct cause of many of the famous events of history that have marched across the world&#39;s stage as empires collided and battled for the right to tax the loser. For Good and Evil is the first book to examine how taxation has been a key factor in world events. Like the Rosetta Stone - a tax document - the book sheds fresh light onto much of history. Did you know that biblical Israel split after Solomon&#39;s death because his son refused to cut taxes? That Rome rose to greatness due to a liberal tax regime but declined under corrupt and inefficient ones? That in Britain, Lady Godiva made her famous ride as a tax protest? That in Switzerland William Tell shot the apple off his son&#39;s head as punishment for tax resistance? Or that Fort Sumter, where the first shots of the Civil War were fired, was a Customs House? Combining facts with thought-provoking comment he frequently draws parallels between tax events of the past and those of the present. Finding fault with the way Western civilization is taxed, Adams provides ideas for curing those faults by using the valuable lessons that history has taught. The special value of this refreshing new look at history lies in the lessons to be drawn by all thinking taxpayers. &#34;Taxes are the fuel that makes civilization run, but how we tax and spend determines to a large extent whether we are prosperous or poor, free or enslaved, and most importantly, good or evil&#34;. Once you read ForGood and Evil, you&#39;ll never feel the same about taxes!STEWART &amp; SALLY WALTON are well known television artists and authors of craft and home decorating books.

His critics have charged him with obscenity and misogyny, and his outspoken attacks on Islam, which he has called the most stupid religion, landed him in court in 2002 on a charge of inciting racial hatred, of which he was acquitted.<br><br>Houellebecq also hit the headlines after savage exchanges with his estranged mother Lucie Ceccaldi; he painted a deeply unflattering portrait of her in his novel Plateforme, and she responded by writing a book of her own in which she called him a liar and a parasite.<br><br>His new novel in English, The Map and the Territory, though the novel itself has yet to be translated has been described as part-thriller and part-satire. It features a reclusive, misanthropic artist, and a handful of actual French media celebrities, including author Houellebecq, an alcoholic with poor personal hygiene. The novel revolves around the investigation into Houellebecq's sadistic murder: the unfortunate man is decapitated.<br><br>The book brought more controversy when it was published by Flammarion in September, with Houellebecq being accused of copying passages verbatim from Wikipedia. The novelist responded that taking passages word for word was not stealing so long as the motives were to recycle them for artistic purposes, citing the influence of Georges Perec amongst others.<br><br>The prize win is thought to right a perceived embarassment within the French literary world that Houellebecq has achieved fame and wide readership outside his own country but had never won the Prix Goncourt. He narrowly missed out in both 1998 and 2005. --The Guardian</p><h2>Henri Matisse: Jazz</h2><p>imited Edition.

Beveridge and Paul Rocheleau<br>Edited and designed by David Larkin<br><br>A man of passionate vision and drive, Frederick Law Olmsted defined and named the profession of landscape architecture and designed America's most beloved parks and landscapes of the past century--New York's Central Park, Brooklyn's Prospect Park, the U.S. Capitol grounds, the Biltmore Estate, and many others. During a remarkable forty-year career that began in the mid-1800s, Olmsted created the first park systems, urban greenways, and suburban residential communities in this country. He was a pivotal figure in the movement to create and preserve natural parks such as Yosemite, Yellowstone, and Niagara Falls; and he contributed to the design of many academic campuses, including Stanford University in Palo Alto, California.<br><br>Today there is a resurgence of interest in Olmsted's work and legacy in both the United States and Europe. This timely volume, following the format of Rizzoli's successful <i>Masterworks</i> series, presents the breadth of Olmsted's work in expansive, beautiful color photographs by Paul Rocheleau, who conceived this book. The engaging text illuminates Olmsted's role as an indefatigable administrator and social reformer, a man who slept a scant few hours each night and rallied around causes ranging from anti-slavery to sanitary regulation. Olmsted's career refelected a deep concern for fostering community and using the restorative effects of natural scenery to counteract the debilitating forces of the modern city. 'Olmsted's goal was to help create an American society where all people had the qualities of gentility,' writes author Beveridge, an eminent Olmsted scholar.<br><br><b>Charles E.

Later, I got to know major entertainment executives such as Joe Smith of Elektra/Asylum Records and Peter Guber of Sony Pictures because they had courtside Lakers tickets. When we socialized after games, they&#x2019;d ask me about basketball&#x2014;and I&#x2019;d pick their brains about business.<br>&nbsp;<br>Still, it was J. Bruce Llewellyn, one of the most successful black men in America, who sent me off with a mission on my journey from basketball player to businessman. The son of Jamaican immigrants, he built an empire that includes one of the nation&#x2019;s largest Coca-Cola distributorships, a cable and broadcasting company, and <i>Essence </i>magazine.<br>&nbsp;<br>When we met, I got right to the point.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I want to be a businessman after basketball,&#x201d; I told him. &#x201c;I want to make a lot of money like you.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mr. Llewellyn let me babble on like that for several minutes before he cut me off with a wave of his hand.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;No, Magic,&#x201d; he said; &#x201c;if money is all you want, there willnever be enough of it and you will never be happy. You&#x2019;ve got to be about more than that.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>He had my attention. What did he mean?<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You have the opportunity to be a leader who can do great things and change people&#x2019;s lives for the better,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You can be a businessman who is also a catalyst for change.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>This great entrepreneur offered me more than I&#x2019;d bargained for. Since high school, I&#x2019;d sought out advice from every successful businessperson I&#x2019;d met. This was the first person who had a bigger vision for me than I had for myself.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>A catalyst for change?</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br>That was a role I&#x2019;d never imagined. I thought you had to be Nelson Mandela or the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., to change the world. I learned instead that each of us can make a difference, even if it is one street corner at a time. <br>&nbsp;<br>I still saw myself as an athlete&#x2014;a player who performed well on the basketball court and hopefully excited a few fans. I figured once my NBA days were over I&#x2019;d fade from the public view and focus on building wealth and a family.<br>&nbsp;<br>God has a way of telling you what you are supposed to be doing. He gets the message out one way or another until you finally pay attention.<br>&nbsp;<br>That meeting with J. Bruce Llewellyn was a defining moment. He changed my perspective by challenging me to expand my goals as a person and as an entrepreneur.<br>&nbsp;<br>A few weeks after my talk with him, God sent another messenger by the name of John Mack, who led the Urban League of Los Angeles for more than thirty-five years. <br>&nbsp;<br>Mr. Mack asked me to join the Urban League. Then he too challenged me.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got to become a leader in this community,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You need to get involved and learn how things work.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Bruce Llewellyn and John Mack opened my eyes and my mind to a much bigger world.<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#x2019;d thought I was living large as a member of the Lakers. Yet once I immersed myself in business and joined the Urban League, I realized that an athlete&#x2019;s life offers a very limited perspective.<br>&nbsp;<br>Over time, I came to understand the vision others had for me. I made the next big step in my manhood when I heeded the advice of those two strong and committed leaders. They refocused my vision for my life, and I resolved to first make a difference in the world and let the money take care of itself.<br>&nbsp;<br>To accomplish that mission, I went back to school in the classroom of the real world. I was lucky. I had access to brilliant men and women of all races who gave me guidance&#x2014;from <i>Black Enterprise </i>publisher Earl Graves to Lakers owner Jerry Buss and Hollywood superagent Michael Ovitz.<br>&nbsp;<br>Even with those great minds to guide me, I had a lot to learn. Certainly, I made mistakes, and I will share what I learned from them in the pages that follow. To stay true to my mission, I will share the story of my journey from basketball to boardroom while also providing guidance to aspiring entrepreneurs.<br>&nbsp;<br>Before we begin, I encourage you, just as Mr. Llewellyn and Mr. Mack encouraged me, to think of yourself and your business as catalysts for positive change in your community. Make a difference, and making money will follow.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>Three Plays</h2><p>This collection features <i>Ma Rainey's Black Bottom</i>, voted Best Play of 1984-85 by the New York Drama Critics' Circle, <i>Fences</i>, winner of the 1987 Pulitzer Prize for Drama, and <i>Joe Turner's Come and Gone</i>, voted Best Play of 1987-88 by the New York Drama Critics' Circle.</p><p>&#x201c;With the benefit of 20 years of hindsight, one can posit that the maiden performance of "Ma Rainey" inaugurated the August Wilson era.&nbsp; As both an individual playwright and a hub of theatrical activity, he has defined his time in the way Eugene O'Neill, Arthur Miller and Tennessee Williams, Neil Simon and Edward Albee defined the three preceding generations.&#x201d; <br><i>--New York Times</i> on <i>Ma Rainey</i><br><br><p>&#x201c;Few things in publishing can be called a coup.

While not every title we publish becomes a <i>New York Times</i> bestseller, a national bestseller, or a Hugo or Nebula award-winner, we are committed to publishing quality books from a diverse group of authors.</p><p><b>Martha Wells</b> is the author of more than a dozen science fiction and fantasy novels, including the Ile-Rien series (<i>The Death of the Necromancer</i>) and the Books of the Raksura (<i>The Cloud Roads</i>). Her work has been nominated for the Nebula and Compton Crook awards, and published in seven languages. Wells lives in College Station, Texas.The venerated pulp spirit in science fiction and fantasy has dwindledsince the golden age of the 1920s to '50s. Yet an atavistic craving foradventure remains, and it is this need that Wells's books in general and the Raksura books in particular satisfy. The stories arestraightforward adventure, but what makes Wells's "new pulp" feel freshis its refusal to take the easier storytelling routes of its forebears.Rather than thinly veil an existing human society as alien others, forexample, Wells--a master world builder--creates a multicultural world ofhumanized monsters. Rather than caricature anyone who isn't white andmale, as pulp too often did, Wells casually includes characters likeShade, a pampered princess among his people who looks like a white manbut can transform into a huge polyamorous humanoid dragon. This ischaracteristic of the series. The result is breathtakingly surprisingand fun.

Based on the true story of a young Japanese girl who contracts leukemia as a result of the atom bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima, the story follows Sadako as a healthy schoolgirl winning relay races, through her diagnosis with the atom bomb sickness, to her long stay in the hospital. It is in the hospital that she first begins making origami cranes to pass the time. Her ultimate goal is to make 1000, but she dies with only 644 completed. Sadako's classmates finish making the remaining cranes, and all 1000 are buried with her. Read by Christina Moore, the recording has excellent narration and sound quality and is particularly notable for the children's voices. Moore uses subtle nuances to distinguish between characters, and conveys a sense of Sadako's gentle spirit and courage. The recording is further enriched at the end by an interesting biography of Eleanor Coerr that explains how the author came to write Sadako's story.

Heals a different heartache. &#39;milk and honey&#39; takes readers through a journey of the most bitter moments in life and finds sweetness in them because there is sweetness everywhere if you are just willing to look.</p><p>Rupi Kaur is a writer based in Toronto, Canada.

From<i>The Cat in the Hat</i> to <i>Oh, the Places You&#x2019;ll Go!</i>, his iconic characters, stories, and art style have been a lasting influence on generations of children and adults. The books he wrote and illustrated under the name Dr. Seuss (and others that he wrote but did not illustrate, including some under the pseudonyms Theo. LeSieg and Rosetta Stone) have been translated into thirty languages. Hundreds of millions of copies have found their way into homes and hearts around the world. Dr. Seuss&#x2019;s long list of awards includes Caldecott Honors for <i>McElligot&#x2019;s Pool</i>, <i>If I Ran the Zoo</i>, and<i>Bartholomew and the Oobleck</i>, the Pulitzer Prize, and eight honorary doctorates. Works based on his original stories have won three Oscars, three Emmys, three Grammys, and a Peabody. Dr. Seuss's never-before-seen picture book<i>What Pet Should I Get?</i> will be published on July 28, 2015. The rediscovered book captures a classic childhood moment&#x2014;the selection of a pet&#x2014;and uses it to illustrate a life-lesson: that it is hard to make up your mind, but that sometimes you just have to do it!</p><h2>Thomas Guide: Los Angeles &amp; Orange Counties (The Thomas Guide Streetguide)</h2><p>FEATURES<br> 2015 copyright<br> Landscape layout with lay-flat spiral binding <br> Maps, points of interest, and their indexes are completely revised<br> Includes transit information, airports, schools, shopping centers, parks and recreation areas<br> Administrative and zip code boundaries included<br> Block numbers on maps and in index<br> Township tier, range and section numbers<br> Full coverage of over 400 cities and communities including Anaheim, Costa Mesa, Glendale, Irvine, Lancaster, Long Beach, Los Angeles, Mission Viejo, Pasadena, Pomona, Santa Ana, and Santa Clarita.<br><br>Completely Updated <br> Southern California's iconic page and grid system<br> Con gu�a usuaria y leyenda en espa�ol</p><p></p><h2>Flashman on the March from The Flashman Papers, 1867-8</h2><p>It&#x2019;s 1868 and Sir Harry Flashman, V.C., arch-cad, amorist, cold-headed soldier, and reluctant hero, is back!<br><br>Fleeing a chain of vengeful pursuers that includes Mexican bandits, the French Foreign Legion, and the relatives of an infatuated Austrian beauty, Flashy is desperate for somewhere to take cover. So desperate, in fact, that he embarks on a perilous secret intelligence-gathering mission to help free a group of Britons being held captive by a tyrannical Abyssinian king. That mission rapidly turns into one of the most famous expeditions in British military history, and along the way, of course, are nightmare castles, brigands, massacres, rebellions, orgies, and the loveliest and most lethal women in Africa&#x2013;including a voluptuous African queen with a weakness for stalwart adventurers whom she nonetheless occasionally throws to her pet lions&#x2013;who will test the limits of the great bounder&#x2019;s talents for knavery, amorous intrigue, and survival.<br><br><i>Flashman on the March&#x2013;</i>the twelfth book in George MacDonald Fraser&#x2019;s ever-beloved, always scandalous Flashman Papers series&#x2013;is Flashman and Fraser at their best.</p><p>George MacDonald Fraser was born in England and schooled in Scotland. He served in a Highland regiment in India, Africa, and the Middle East, and now lives on the Isle of Man.&#x201c;Half a million in silver, did you say?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;In Maria Theresa dollars. Worth a hundred thou&#x2019; in quids.&#x201d; He held up a gleaming coin, broad as a crown, with the old girl double-chinned on one side and the Austrian arms on t&#x2019;other. &#x201c;Dam&#x2019; disinheritin&#x2019; old bitch, what? Mind, they say she was a plum in her youth, blonde and buxom, just your sort, Flashy&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Ne&#x2019;er mind my sort. The cash must reach this place in Africa within four weeks? And the chap who was to have escorted it is laid up in Venice with yellow jack?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Or the clap, or the sailor&#x2019;s itch, or heaven knows what.&#x201d; He spun the coin, grinning foxy-like. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve changed your mind, haven&#x2019;t you? You&#x2019;re game to do it yourself! Good old Flash!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t rush your fences, Speed, my boy. When&#x2019;s it due to be shipped out?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Wednesday. Lloyd packet to Alexandria. But with Sturgess comin&#x2019; all over yellow in Venice, that won&#x2019;t do, and there ain&#x2019;t another Alex boat for a fortnight&#x2014;far too late, and the Embassy&#x2019;ll run my guts up the flagpole, as though &#x2019;twas my fault, confound &#x2019;em&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Aye, it&#x2019;s hell in the diplomatic. Well, tell you what, Speed&#x2014;I&#x2019;ll ride guard on your dollars to Alex for you, but I ain&#x2019;t waiting till Wednesday. I want to be clear of this blasted town by dawn tomorrow, so you&#x2019;d best drum up a steam-launch and crew, and get your precious treasure aboard tonight&#x2014;where is it just now?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;At the station, the Strada Ferrata&#x2014;but dammit, Flash, a private charter&#x2019;ll cost the moon&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got Embassy dibs, haven&#x2019;t you? Then use &#x2019;em! The station ain&#x2019;t spitting distance from the Klutsch mole, and if you get a move on you can have the gelt loaded by midnight. Heavens, man, steam craft and spaghetti sailors are ten a penny in Trieste! If you&#x2019;re in such a sweat to get the dollars to Africa&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You may believe it! Let me see . . . quick run to Alex, then train to Cairo and on to Suez&#x2014;no camel caravans across the desert these days, but you&#x2019;ll need to hire nigger porters&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;For which you&#x2019;ll furnish me cash!&#x201d;<br><br> He waved a hand. &#x201c;Sturgess would&#x2019;ve had to hire &#x2019;em, anyway. At Suez one of our Navy sloops&#x2019;ll take you down the Red Sea&#x2014;there are shoals of &#x2019;em, chasin&#x2019; the slavers, and I&#x2019;ll give you an Embassy order. They&#x2019;ll have you at Zoola&#x2014;that&#x2019;s the port for Abyssinia&#x2014;by the middle of February, and it can&#x2019;t take above a week to get the silver up-country to this place called Attegrat. That&#x2019;s where General Napier will be.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Napier? Not Bob the Bughunter? What the blazes is he doing in Abyssinia? We haven&#x2019;t got a station there.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We have by now, you may be sure!&#x201d; He was laughing in disbelief. &#x201c;D&#x2019;you mean to tell me you haven&#x2019;t heard? Why, he&#x2019;s invadin&#x2019; the place! With an army from India! The silver is to help fund his campaign, don&#x2019;t you see? Good God, Flashy, where have you been? Oh, I was forgettin&#x2019;&#x2014;Mexico. Dash it, don&#x2019;t they have newspapers there?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Hold up, can&#x2019;t you? Why is he invading?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;To rescue the captives&#x2014;our consul, envoys, missionaries! They&#x2019;re held prisoner by this mad cannibal king, and he&#x2019;s chainin&#x2019; &#x2019;em, and floggin&#x2019; &#x2019;em, and kickin&#x2019; up no end of a row! Theodore, his name is&#x2014;and you mean to say you&#x2019;ve not heard of him? I&#x2019;ll be damned&#x2014;why, there&#x2019;s been uproar in Parliament, our gracious Queen writin&#x2019; letters, a penny or more on the income tax&#x2014;it&#x2019;s true! Now d&#x2019;you see why this silver must reach Napier double quick&#x2014;if it don&#x2019;t, he&#x2019;ll be adrift in the middle of nowhere with not a penny to his name, and your old chum Speedicut will be a human sacrifice at the openin&#x2019; of the new Foreign Office!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;But why should Napier need Austrian silver? Hasn&#x2019;t he got any sterling?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Abyssinian niggers won&#x2019;t touch it, or anythin&#x2019; except Maria Theresas. Purest silver, you see, and Napier must have it for food and forage when he marches up-country to fight his war.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;So it&#x2019;s a war-chest? You never said a dam&#x2019; word about war last night.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You never gave me a chance, did you? Soon as I told you I was in Dickie&#x2019;s meadow, with this damned fortune to be shipped and Sturgess in dock, what sympathy did dear old friend Flashy offer? The horse&#x2019;s laugh, and wished me joy! All for England, home, and the beauteous Elspeth, you were . . . and now,&#x201d; says he, with that old leery Speedicut look, &#x201c;all of a sudden, you&#x2019;re in the dooce of a hurry to oblige . . . What&#x2019;s up, Flash?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Not a dam&#x2019; thing. I&#x2019;m sick of Trieste and want away, that&#x2019;s all!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;And can&#x2019;t wait a day? You and Hookey Walker!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Now, see here, Speed, d&#x2019;ye want me to shift your blasted bullion, or don&#x2019;t you? Well, I go tonight or not at all, and since this cash is so all-fired important to Napier, your Embassy funds can stand the row for my passage home, too, when the thing&#x2019;s done! Well, what d&#x2019;ye say?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;That something is up, no error!&#x201d; His eyes widened. &#x201c;I say, the Austrian traps ain&#x2019;t after you, are they&#x2014;&#x2019;cos if they were I daren&#x2019;t assist your flight, silver or no silver! Dash it, I&#x2019;m a diplomat&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Of course &#x2019;tain&#x2019;t the traps! What sort of fellow d&#x2019;ye think I am? Good God, ha&#x2019;nt we been chums since boyhood?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, and it&#x2019;s &#x2019;cos I know what kind of chum you can be that I repeat &#x2018;What&#x2019;s up, Flash?&#x2019; &#x201d; He filled my glass and pushed it across. &#x201c;Come up, old boy! This is old Speed, remember, and you can&#x2019;t humbug him.&#x201d;<br><br> Well, true enough, I couldn&#x2019;t, and since you, dear reader, may be sharing his curiosity, I&#x2019;ll tell you what I told him that night in the H�tel Victoria&#x2014;not the smartest pub in Trieste, but as a patriotic little minion of our Vienna Embassy, Speedicut was bound to put up there&#x2014;and it should explain the somewhat cryptic exchanges with which I&#x2019;ve begun this chapter of my memoirs. If they&#x2019;ve seemed a mite bewildering you&#x2019;ll see presently that they were the simplest way of setting out the preliminaries to my tale of the strangest campaign in the whole history of British arms&#x2014;and that takes in some damned odd affairs, a few of which I&#x2019;ve borne a reluctant hand in myself. But Abyssinia took the cake, currants and all. Never anything like it, and never will be again.<br><br> For me, the business began in the summer of &#x2019;67, on the day when that almighty idiot, the Emperor Maximilian of Mexico, strode out before a Juarista firing squad, unbuttoned his shirt cool as a trout, and cried &#x201c;Viva M�jico! Viva la independencia! Shoot, soldiers, through the heart!&#x201d; Which they did, with surprising accuracy for a platoon of dagoes, thereby depriving Mexico of its crowned head and Flashy of his employer and protector. I was an anxious spectator skulking in cover on a rooftop nearby, and when I saw Max take a header into the dust I knew that the time had come for me to slip my cable.<br><br> You see, I&#x2019;d been his fairly loyal aide-de-camp in his recent futile struggle against Juarez&#x2019;s republicans&#x2014;not a post I&#x2019;d taken from choice, but I&#x2019;d been a deserter from the French Foreign Legion at the time. They were polluting Mexico with their presence in those days, supporting Max on behalf of his sponsor, that ghastly louse Louis Napoleon, and I&#x2019;d been only too glad of the refuge Max had offered me&#x2014;he&#x2019;d been under the mistaken impression that I&#x2019;d saved his life in an ambush at Texatl, poor ass, when in fact I&#x2019;d been one of Jes�s Montero&#x2019;s gang of ambushers, but we needn&#x2019;t go into that at the moment. What mattered was that Max had taken me on the strength, and had given the Legion peelers the right about when they&#x2019;d come clamouring for my unhappy carcase.<br><br> Then the Frogs cleared out in March of &#x2019;67, leaving Max in the lurch with typical Gallic loyalty, but while that removed one menace to my well-being, there remained others from which Max could be no protection, quick or dead&#x2014;like the Juaristas, who&#x2019;d rather have strung up a royalist a.d.c. than eaten their dinners, or that persevering old bandolero Jes�s Montero, who was bound to find out eventually that I didn&#x2019;t know where Montezuma&#x2019;s treasure was. Hell of a place, Mexico, and dam&#x2019; confused.<br><br> But all you need to know for the present is that after Max bought the bullet I&#x2019;d have joined him in the dead-cart if it hadn&#x2019;t been for the delectable Princess Agnes Salm-Salm, and the still happily ignorant Jes�s. They&#x2019;d been my associates in a botched attempt to rescue Max on the eve of his execution. We&#x2019;d failed because (you&#x2019;ll hardly credit this) the great clown had refused point-blank to escape because it didn&#x2019;t sort with his imperial dignity, Austro-Hungarian royalty preferring to die rather than go over the wall. Well, hell mend &#x2019;em, I say, and if the House of Hapsburg goes to the knackers it won&#x2019;t be my fault; I&#x2019;ve done my unwillin...</p><h2>The Country Ahead of Us, The Country Behind</h2><p>Like his novel, Snow Falling On Cedars, for which he received the PEN/Faulkner Award, Guterson&#39;s beautifully observed and emotionally piercing short stories are set largely in the Pacific Northwest.

In those vast landscapes, hunting, fishing, and sports are the givens of men&#39;s lives. But although Guterson&#39;s characters go into the wilderness in search of mallards or silver trout, they discover other things instead: the decay of their youthful ardor; the motiveless cruelty of strangers; their own capacity for deception and grief.David Guterson is the author of a collection of short stories, <b>The Country Ahead of Us, the Country Behind; Family Matters: Why Homeschooling Makes Sense; Snow Falling on Cedars</b>, which won the 1995 PEN/Faulkner Award, the Pacific Northwest Bookseller Association Award, and was an international bestseller; and the national bestseller <b>East of the Mountains</b>.</p><h2>The Wind Through the Keyhole (Dark Tower)</h2><p>The number one international bestseller. For readers new to the dark tower, the wind through the keyhole is a stand-alone novel, and a wonderful introduction to the series. It is a story within a story, which features both the younger and older gunslinger roland on his quest to find the dark tower. Fans of the existing seven books in the series will also delight in discovering what happened to roland and his ka tet between the time they leave the emerald city and arrive at the outskirts of calla bryn sturgis. This russian doll of a novel, a story within a story, within a story, visits mid-world&#39;s last gunslinger, roland deschain, and his ka-tet as a ferocious storm halts their progress along the path of the beam. (the novel can be placed between dark tower iv and dark tower v.) roland tells a tale from his early days as a gunslinger, in the guilt ridden year following his mother&#39;s death. Sent by his father to investigate evidence of a murderous shape shifter, a &#39;skin man,&#39; roland takes</p><p>&#39;At the age of 19 Stephen decided he would like to write an epic similar to The Lord of the Rings. The &#39;spaghetti Westerns&#39; of that time [specifically The Good, the Bad and the Ugly] and a poem written by Robert Browning, &#39;Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came&#39;, became the inspiration for his magnum opus. The series written and published separately over a period of 22 years consists of seven books and the short story, &#39;The Little Sisters of Eluria&#39; published in his short story collection, EVERYTHING&#39;S EVENTUAL.&#39; From the author&#39;s website.An excerpt from <i>The Wind through the Keyhole: A Dark Tower Novel </i>by Stephen King<p>&nbsp;</p><p>FOREWORD</p><p>Most of the people holding this book have followed the adventures of Roland and his band&#x2014;his ka-tet&#x2014;for years, some of them from the very beginning. Others&#x2014;and I hope there are many, newcomers and Constant Readers alike&#x2014;may ask, <i>Can I read and enjoy this</i> <i>story if I haven&#x2019;t read the other Dark Tower books? </i>My answer is yes, if you keep a few things in mind. </p><p>First, Mid-World lies next to our world, and there are many overlaps. In some places there are doorways between the two worlds, and sometimes there are thin places, porous places, where the two worlds actually mingle. Three of Roland&#x2019;s ka-tet&#x2014;Eddie, Susannah, and Jake have been drawn separately from troubled lives in New York into Roland&#x2019;s Mid-World quest. Their fourth traveling companion, a billy-bumbler named Oy, is a golden-eyed creature native to Mid-World. Mid-World is very old, and falling to ruin, filled with monsters and untrustworthy magic. </p><p>Second, Roland Deschain of Gilead is a gunslinger&#x2014;one of a small band that tries to keep order in an increasingly lawless world. If you think of the gunslingers of Gilead as a strange combination of knights errant and territorial marshals in the Old West, you&#x2019;ll be close to the mark. Most of them, although not all, are descended from the line of the old White King, known as Arthur Eld (I told you there were overlaps).</p><p>Third, Roland has lived his life under a terrible curse. He killed his mother, who was having an affair&#x2014;mostly against her will, and certainly against her better judgment&#x2014;with a fellow you will meet in these pages. Although it was by mistake, he holds himself accountable, and the unhappy Gabrielle Deschain&#x2019;s death has haunted him since his young manhood. These events are fully narrated in the Dark Tower cycle, but for our purposes here, I think it&#x2019;s all you have to know. </p><p>For longtime readers, this book should be shelved between <i>Wizard</i> <i>and Glass </i>and <i>Wolves of the Calla </i>. . . which makes it, I suppose, <i>Dark Tower 4.5.</i></p><p>As for me, I was delighted to discover my old friends had a little more to say. It was a great gift to find them again, years after I thought their stories were told.</p><p>&#x2014;Stephen King</p><p>September 14, 2011</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>STARKBLAST</p><p>During the days after they left the Green Palace that wasn&#x2019;t Oz after all&#x2014;but which was now the tomb of the unpleasant fellow Roland&#x2019;s ka-tet had known as the Tick-Tock Man&#x2014;the boy Jake began to range farther and farther ahead of Roland, Eddie, and Susannah.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you worry about him?&#x201d; Susannah asked Roland. &#x201c;Out there on his own?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s got Oy with him,&#x201d; Eddie said, referring to the billy-bumbler who had adopted Jake as his special friend. &#x201c;Mr. Oy gets along with nice folks all right, but he&#x2019;s got a mouthful of sharp teeth for those who aren&#x2019;t so nice. As that guy Gasher found out to his sorrow.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Jake also has his father&#x2019;s gun,&#x201d; Roland said. &#x201c;And he knows how to use it. That he knows very well. And he won&#x2019;t leave the Path of the Beam.&#x201d; He pointed overhead with his reduced hand. The lowhanging sky was mostly still, but a single corridor of clouds moved</p><p>steadily southeast. Toward the land of Thunderclap, if the note left behind for them by the man who styled himself RF had told the truth.</p><p>Toward the Dark Tower.</p><p>&#x201c;But why&#x2014;&#x201d; Susannah began, and then her wheelchair hit a bump. She turned to Eddie. &#x201c;Watch where you&#x2019;re pushin me, sugar.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; Eddie said. &#x201c;Public Works hasn&#x2019;t been doing any maintenance along this stretch of the turnpike lately. Must be dealing with budget cuts.&#x201d;</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t a turnpike, but it <i>was </i>a road . . . or had been: two ghostly ruts with an occasional tumbledown shack to mark the way. Earlier that morning they had even passed an abandoned store with a barely readable sign: TOOK&#x2019;S OUTLAND MERCANTILE. They investigated inside for supplies&#x2014;Jake and Oy had still been with them then&#x2014;and had found nothing but dust, ancient cobwebs, and the skeleton of what had been either a large raccoon, a small dog, or a billy-bumbler. Oy had taken a cursory sniff and then pissed on the bones before leaving the store to sit on the hump in the middle of the old road with his squiggle of a tail curled around him. He faced back the way they had come, sniffing the air. </p><p>Roland had seen the bumbler do this several times lately, and although he had said nothing, he pondered it. Someone trailing them, maybe? He didn&#x2019;t actually believe this, but the bumbler&#x2019;s posture&#x2014;nose lifted, ears pricked, tail curled&#x2014;called up some old memory or association that he couldn&#x2019;t quite catch.</p><p>&#x201c;Why does Jake want to be on his own?&#x201d; Susannah asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you find it worrisome, Susannah of New York?&#x201d; Roland asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, Roland of Gilead, I find it <i>worrisome.</i>&#x201d; She smiled amiably enough, but in her eyes, the old mean light sparkled. That was the Detta Walker part of her, Roland reckoned. It would never be completely gone, and he wasn&#x2019;t sorry. Without the strange woman she had once been still buried in her heart like a chip of ice, she would have been only a handsome black woman with no legs below the knees. With Detta onboard, she was a person to be reckoned with. A dangerous one. A gunslinger.</p><p>&#x201c;He has plenty of stuff to think about,&#x201d; Eddie said quietly. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s been through a lot. Not every kid comes back from the dead. And it&#x2019;s like Roland says&#x2014;if someone tries to face him down, it&#x2019;s the someone who&#x2019;s apt to be sorry.&#x201d; Eddie stopped pushing the wheelchair, armed sweat from his brow, and looked at Roland. &#x201c;<i>Are </i>there someones in this particular suburb of nowhere, Roland? Or have they all moved on?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, there are a few, I wot.&#x201d;</p><p>He did more than wot; they had been peeked at several times as they continued their course along the Path of the Beam. Once by a frightened woman with her arms around two children and a babe hanging in a sling from her neck. Once by an old farmer, a half-mutie with a jerking tentacle that hung from one corner of his mouth. Eddie and Susannah had seen none of these people, or sensed the others that Roland felt sure had, from the safety of the woods and high grasses, marked their progress. Eddie and Susannah had a lot to learn. </p><p>But they had learned at least some of what they would need, it seemed, because Eddie now asked, &#x201c;Are they the ones Oy keeps scenting up behind us?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; Roland thought of adding that he was sure something else was on Oy&#x2019;s strange little bumbler mind, and decided not to. The gunslinger had spent long years with no ka-tet, and keeping his own counsel had become a habit. One he would have to break, if the tet was to remain strong. But not now, not this morning.</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s move on,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure we&#x2019;ll find Jake waiting for us up ahead.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Two hours later, just shy of noon, they breasted a rise and halted, looking down at a wide, slow-moving river, gray as pewter beneath the overcast sky. On the northwestern bank&#x2014;their side&#x2014;was a barnlike building painted a green so bright it seemed to yell into the muted day. Its mouth jutted out over the water on pilings painted a similar green. Docked to two of these pilings by thick hawsers was a large raft, easily ninety feet by ninety, painted in alternating stripes of red and yellow. A tall wooden pole that looked like a mast jutted from the center, but there was no sign of a sail. Several wicker chairs sat in front of it, facing the shore on their side of the river. Jake was seated in one of these. Next to him was an old man in a vast straw hat, baggy green pants, and longboots. On his top half he wore a thin white garment&#x2014;the kind of shirt Roland thought of as a slinkum. Jake and the old man appeared to be eating well-stuffed popkins. Roland&#x2019;s mouth sprang water at the sight of them.</p><p>Oy was beyond them, at the edge of the circus-painted raft, looking raptly down at his own reflection. Or perhaps at the reflection of the steel cable that ran overhead, spanning the river.</p><p>&#x201c;Is it the Whye?&#x201d; Susannah asked Roland.</p><p>&#x201c;Yar.&#x201d;</p><p>Eddie grinned. &#x201c;You say Whye; I say Whye Not?&#x201d; He raised one hand and waved it over his head. &#x201c;Jake! Hey, Jake! Oy!&#x201d; </p><p>Jake waved back, and although the river and the raft moored at its edge were still half a mile away, their eyes were uniformly sharp, and they saw the white of the boy&#x2019;s teeth as he grinned.</p><p>Susannah cupped her hands around her mouth. &#x201c;Oy! <i>Oy! </i>To me,</p><p>sugar! Come see your mama!&#x201d;</p><p>Uttering shrill yips that were the closest he could get to barks, Oy flew across the raft, disappeared into the barnlike structure, then emerged on their side. He came charging up the path with his ears lowered against his skull and his gold-ringed eyes bright.</p><p>&#x201c;Slow down, sug, you&#x2019;ll give yourself a heart attack!&#x201d; Susannah shouted, laughing.</p><p>Oy seemed to take this as an order to speed up. He arrived at Susannah&#x2019;s wheelchair in less than two minutes, jumped up into her lap, then jumped down again and looked at them cheerfully. &#x201c;Olan! Ed! Suze!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hile, Sir Throcken,&#x201d; Roland said, using the ancient word for bumbler he&#x2019;d first heard in a book read to him by his mother: <i>The</i> <i>Throcken and the Dragon.</i></p><p>Oy lifted his leg, watered a patch of grass, then faced back the way they had come, scenting at the air, eyes on the horizon. </p><p>&#x201c;Why does he keep doing that, Roland?&#x201d; Eddie asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; But he <i>almost </i>knew.

Fleming, M.D. is the founder and director of the Fleming Heart and Health Institute, located in Omaha, Nebraska. Thousands of people from around the world come to the Fleming Institute for treatment of heart disease, cancer, and nutrition-related disorders.The author, a nuclear cardiologist and founder of the Fleming Heart and Health Institute in Omaha, Neb., builds on his earlier work (How to Bypass Your Bypass: What Your Doctor Doesn't Tell You About Cholesterol and Your Diet) to identify in this reader-friendly guide 12 risk factors for heart disease. According to Fleming, these factors-which include high blood cholesterol level (over 150), excess weight, elevated homocysteine (resulting from eating too much animal protein) and oxidants in the blood stream-trigger an inflammatory reaction that causes heart disease and may also be responsible for diabetes, arthritis and other serious conditions. Dismissing bypass surgery and angioplasty as short-term solutions, Fleming claims that his suggested diet, combined with regular exercise such as daily walking, will reverse heart disease without medication or surgery. He recommends that his diet be adopted in two phases: phase one is composed solely of fruit and vegetables; after consistent improvement in cardiac health has been accomplished, phase two, which adds whole grains, low-fat dairy and moderate servings of protein, may be undertaken. A variety of sample recipes and menus are provided. Fleming is opposed to the currently popular high-protein diets for losing weight. Although his exercise and eating plan certainly promotes health, the diet, which also eliminates caffeine, may discourage those who find it too restrictive. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

His biggest problem is dealing with his new friend, Tyson-a six-foot-three, mentally challenged homeless kid who follows Percy everywhere, making it hard for Percy to have any �&#x20ac;&#x153;normal�&#x20ac;? friends.</p><p>But things dont stay quiet for long. Percy soon discovers there is trouble at Camp Half-Blood: the magical borders which protect Half-Blood Hill have been poisoned by a mysterious enemy, and the only safe haven for demigods is on the verge of being overrun by mythological monsters. To save the camp, Percy needs the help of his best friend, Grover, who has been taken prisoner by the Cyclops Polyphemus on an island somewhere in the Sea of Monsters, the dangerous waters Greek heroes have sailed for millennia �&#x20ac;&#x201c; only today, the Sea of Monsters goes by a new name the Bermuda Triangle.</p><br><br></p><p><strong>Rick Riordan</strong> is also the author of the best-selling <i>Percy Jackson and the Olympians, Book One: The Lightning Thief </i>and <i>Percy Jackson and the Olympians, Book Three: The Titan's Curse.</i> His previous novels for adults include the hugely popular Tres Navarre series, winner of the top three awards in the mystery genre. He lives in San Antonio, Texas, with his wife and two sons.This action-packed book (second in a series) will delight fans of Percy Jackson, the half-blood son of Poseidon, as Percy once again battles mythical monsters in modern-day settings while on his mission to save the tree that guards Camp Half-Blood. Narrator Jesse Berns helps listeners slip right into the oddly engaging world that Riordan creates, in which contemporary teen characters and those from classical mythology intermingle. Berns is so good at accurately portraying teenagers that it's hard to recall he isn't one; Percy's sarcasm and disdainful tones ("Dude?") are just right, though Berns also reveals his ability to become a satyr, cyclops, or guinea pig ("Reep! Reep!") as required. Berns keeps the pace masterfully taut while also allowing listeners time to revel in the book's humor. J.C.G.

Reprint.</p><p>Ursula K. Le Guin has won many Nebula and Hugo Awards, as well as a National Book Award, a Pushcart Prize, the Harold D. Vursell Memorial Award of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, a Newbery Honor and the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement.In her introduction to this reprint collection of eight of her more recent SF stories, Le Guin (Tehanu) defends the best work of the genre as "beautiful." It is critics and reviewers, she claims, who miss that beauty by emphasizing SF's role as an expositor of ideas. In any case, it's clear that the stories presented here show the softer side of the genre at its best. "The First Contact with the Gorgonids" and "The Ascent of the North Face," the two entries that Le Guin calls "funny stories, silly stories," are just that-witty, satirical and amusing. Yet it is the author's more serious work that displays her talents best, as she employs recurring themes and elements-cultural diversity, unlikely heroes and heroines, power's ability to corrupt, love's power to guide-and considers characters and types (women, children, the differently sexed and gendered) so often disenfranchised by other, more technologically oriented SF writers. From the briefest nonhumorous story here ("The Kerastion," about a silent flute made of human skin) to the longest, eponymous one, Le Guin ponders the nature of art and how life should be lived. Always, her stories are about people, not technologies, and it is this emphasis, as well as her accomplished prose, that makes this such a classy and valuable collection. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Red Mutiny: Eleven Fateful Days on the Battleship Potemkin</h2><p>The true story of the deadliest naval mutiny in history<br><br>In 1905, after being served rancid meat, more than seven hundred Russian sailors mutinied against their officers aboard what was then one of the most powerful battleships in the world. Theirs was a life barely worth living -- a life of hard labor and bitter oppression, an existence, in its hopelessness and injustice, not unlike that of most of the working class in Russia at the time. Certainly their rebellion came as no surprise. Still, against any reasonable odds of success, the sailors-turned-revolutionaries, led by the charismatic firebrand Matyushenko, risked their lives to take control of the ship and fly the red flag of revolution. What followed was a violent port-to-port chase that spanned eleven harrowing days and came to symbolize the Russian revolution itself.<br><br>A pulse-quickening story that alternates between the opulent court of Nicholas II and the razor's-edge tension aboard the Potemkin, Red Mutiny is a tale threaded with terrific adventure, epic naval battles, heroic sacrifices, treachery, bloodlust, and a rallying cry of freedom that would steer the course of the twentieth century. It is also a fine work of scholarship that draws for the first time on the Soviet archives to shed new light on this seminal event in Russian and naval history.<br><br>For readers of Tom Clancy's Hunt for Red October and Nathaniel Philbrick's In the Heart of the Sea, Neal Bascomb's gripping adventure at sea is the story of courage, the power of ideas, and the fragile nature of alliance.</p><p>NEAL BASCOMB is the author of the national bestseller The Perfect Mile, the critically acclaimed Higher, and the award-winning Red Mutiny. A former editor and international journalist, he has also contributed to the New York Times. For Hunting Eichmann, Bascomb tracked down former Nazi soldiers and right-wing radicals in Buenos Aires, traveled to Tel Aviv and Jerusalem to meet with legendary Mossad operatives, uncovered an old memoir by Eichmann on his escape from Germany, and interviewed members of the El Al flight crew involved in Eichmann&#39;s transport to Israel, a story that has never been told. He also made numerous archival discoveries, most notably unearthing the passport that Eichmann used to escape Europe, a discovery that made international headlines.The <i>Potemkin</i> has been the subject of many movies, but only one English-language history of the mutinous Russian battleship exists--<i>The</i> <i>Potemkin Mutiny,</i> by Richard Hough (1960), which did not access Russian naval archives, according to Bascomb. Thus opens a research-and-narration opportunity on which this author completely capitalizes. Presenting a restrained degree of context to the 1905 Revolution, plus brief biographical sketches of the sailors and officers involved in the mutiny, Bascomb swiftly activates the drama of the uprising. Intended by its instigators to ignite a takeover across Russia's Black Sea fleet, followed by socialist revolution, the mutiny actually erupted spontaneously. That forced a "what now" impetus on the incident's ensuing dynamic. Eventually, the <i>Potemkin</i> gave up in Romania, its surviving crew dispersing to write memoirs that Bascomb seamlessly synthesizes with the stories of the <i>Potemkin</i>'s pursuers. Neither pro-red nor pro-white, Bascomb is pro-objectivity in this original rendering of the renowned revolt. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Reading it, you might decide Mr. Mosley grew up reading SF, respects the genre, and still watches SF movies, but has read little SF written during or after the New Wave of the 1960s. However, something more may be going on here than a genre newcomer making beginning-SF-writer mistakes. Mr. Mosley may be deliberately, and craftily, creating SF accessible to his large non-SF readership and to others who are strangers to this genre.</p><p> Some have labeled <i>Futureland</i> cyberpunk, and it does present a dark, infotech-saturated, corporation-controlled future; but it is in fact an inversion of cyberpunk. Instead of that subgenre's cliche of cool, cutting-edge, street-smart, but not very believable outlaws who out-hack and outwit powerful multinational corporations, this Dante-esque collection presents outlaws and outcasts who may be street-wise, but who have little chance of overcoming the corporations and governments that control, and sometimes take, their lives. Like shockingly few other SF works, <i>Futureland</i> directly examines the lives of the working and the nonworking classes, the poor and the marginalized, the criminal and the criminalized. In other words, <i>Futureland</i> is set in a world quite alien to many veteran SF readers, and is therefore a book they should try. <i>--Cynthia Ward</i></p>Walter Mosley is the author of the New York Times bestselling Easy Rawlins novels.

Exceptional Coverage. This authoritative volume starts with a clear introduction to the animal world, examining the reasons for the apparently infinite variety of animal forms and major evolutionary developments. Animal anatomy, life cycles and the principles of classification are also explored. This is followed by a superbly illustrated survey of world habitats, showing how they have adapted to each environment, and the threats that face both wildlife and plants today. The main part of the book, an up-to-date and comprehensive animal catalog, looks in detail at each major group and provides fascinating profiles of over 2,000 individual species. Visually Breathtaking. Spectacular photographic portraits bring a vast array of animals vividly to life, with special features on well-known and important animals such as the Galapagos tortoise. Each species profile is supported by maps and symbols showing distribution and habitat, as well as key information on size, population, and conservation status, forming an invaluable reference database. Outstanding Reference. Clear, comprehensive, and thought provoking, the Smithsonian Animal is essential reading for wildlife enthusiasts of all ages and levels of experience.</p><p>Over 2,000 species, from the tiny spider mite to the massive blue whale, are profiled in DK's astonishingly wonderful <i>Animal</i>, produced in cooperation with the Smithsonian Institution and more than 70 expert zoologists. To call this book "profusely illustrated" is to seriously underrepresent page after page of breathtaking photos capturing each creature in sharp images, thrumming with life. Even the page borders are covered with collages of animal skins to indicate which class of organisms is represented in that section--every inch of this heavy book is gorgeous.<p> Besides heft and beauty, <i>Animal</i> has authority. Editors-in-chief David Burnie and Don E. Wilson are top biologists, and they have assembled a crack team of consultants for each section of the book. For instance, Richard Rosenblatt of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography takes charge of the chapter on fishes, so all the classification, behavior, and distribution data is up-to-date and full of the kind of detail that comes from years of professional specialization. In addition to basic size, location, and status information, each animal gets a short, one- to two-paragraph description, enough to give a feel for the creature:</p><p> </p><blockquote> The blackfin icefish produces a natural "antifreeze," enabling it to survive in the subzero waters of the Antarctic. It lacks red blood cells and hence looks rather pale, but has excellent blood circulation, and a strong heart which weighs as much as that of a small mammal. Its large, toothy mouth led to it being called the crocodile fish by 19th-century whalers. </blockquote><p> Biodiversity has never been more at the forefront of biologists' concerns, and <i>Animal</i> reports on the issues critical to ecology, from habitat loss to the species that are most endangered within each class. </p><p> This book is an ideal browsing reference for all experience levels, as well as a delightful addition to the collection of any animal enthusiast or classroom.

Originally published in 1993,<i> </i>this book has become a classic that has inspired tens of thousands of Westerners to learn to activate their chi&#x2014;life-force energy&#x2014;to improve their health, reduce stress and reverse the effects of aging. This fully revised edition has more than 100 pages of new material, including Longevity Breathing methods; how cross-training in chi gung can enhance other exercises such as yoga, golf and weight training; and nei gung techniques for advanced practitioners. Chi gung exercises utilize a system of energy channels in the body that are similar to an electrical circuit. Frantzis&#x2019; thorough knowledge of energy arts and the Chinese language allow him to peel away the secrecy and metaphors. He presents this 300-page edition in easy to understand terms to suit beginners, with enough meaty detail and depth for the advanced martial artist, healer or meditator. <i>Opening the Energy Gates of Your Body</i> includes a comprehensive guide to chi gung theory and a systematic lesson plan with more than 100 illustrations. These low-impact exercises are suitable for almost any age or fitness level. They provide the foundation for learning any other chi practice, such as tai chi, martial arts, meditation or TAO Yoga. Frantzis explains not only how these inner aerobics are done, but why. Going beyond mere body movement, he teaches from the inside out, linking the biomechanics and anatomy of the physical body with the subtleties of chi. This book provides practical methods to help people become balanced, relaxed and joyful. Frantzis trained for more than a decade in China, became a Taoist Lineage Master&#x2014;quite a rare occurrence&#x2014;and came back to the West to teach. &#x201c;My hope is that chi gung and tai chi can become mainstream exercises in the West,&#x201d; says Frantzis. &#x201c;We have a major health crisis looming; practicing chi gung or tai chi is one of the most effective ways people can reclaim control of their health and well-being.&#x201d;</p><p>Bruce Frantzis<b> </b>is reputed to be the first Westerner to hold authentic lineages in Taoist energy arts. He studied healing, martial arts and meditation with renowned teachers in Asia for 16 years&#x2014;including training in China for more than a decade. Since 1987, Frantzis has taught chi gung, martial arts, TAO yoga, TAO meditation, and energetic-healing therapies to over 15,000 students in the United States and Europe. His teaching methods are spread by a growing number of certified instructors that he has trained in the United States and Europe.Frantzis is the author of several widely praised books about the power of chi including: <i>Tai Chi: Health for Life; </i>the chi gung books, <i>Opening the Energy Gates of Your Body</i> and the<i> Dragon and Tiger Medical Chi Gung Instruction Manual; </i>and two volumes on the water method of TAO meditation<i>, Relaxing Into Your Being</i> and <i>The Great Stillness</i>. Two CDs, <i>The Tao of Letting Go</i> and <i>Ancient Songs of the Tao</i>, shed valuable insights into the power of TAO Meditation in helping people let go of their deepest emotional blockages and move closer to becoming truly alive, balanced and joyful.When Frantzis moved to China to follow the Taoist path of warrior/healer/priest, he was extensively trained in the chi principles and practices that are the basis of Chinese medicine. From 1974 to 1979, he trained with high-level chi gung tui na (therapeutic energy work) doctors and apprenticed under their tutelage in Chinese medical clinics. He learned to use chi to help heal a wide range of conditions including broken bones, nerve and organ damage, and cancer. He also gained an advanced acupuncture degree. Frantzis used these chi principles and practices to dramatically heal himself: first from a life-threatening form of hepatitis in India and more dramatically from massive spine injuries that he received in a car accident in 1981.Frantzis&#x2019; experiences have made him a teacher with a mission: teaching people how the ancient and proven self-healing chi practices can help them achieve health, relaxation, inner peace and longevity. He aims to help avert a major health crisis that threatens to engulf the Western world.<b>Attaining Your True Nature</b>Taoists cherish practices that raise the human being from the "Inferior Man" to the "Superior Man" of the <i>I Ching...</i>To do so, the energy of one's body and emotions needs to be strong and balanced. If you are ill, chi gung will provide you with a means to become healthy; if your mind is disordered, chi gung can give you a way to attain balanced discipline and perseverance. If you are healthy, chi gung can raise your energy level, release suppressed talents, and prepare the body/mind/spirit to succeed in Taoist meditation. All people are born "inferior"&#x2014;it is only through great effort and genuine humility that a person transcends. All sane people wish to be healthy and strong; all those interested in spirituality wish to attain their true nature. In Taoism, chi gung is the first basic method for achieving these very human goals. (Note to the Reader of the New Edition)<b>Chi Gung Works with the Fluids of the Body</b>In chi gung, blood is circulated without stress on the heart. Unlike aerobics, chi gung does not dramatically increase the heart rate during exercise. The object of chi gung is not to make the heart pump more strongly, but to increase the elasticity of the vascular system. As the vessels expand and contract with more vigor, the heart does not need to pump as strongly, thereby providing it with more rest. The lymph fluids are moved primarily by tiny muscular expansions and contractions. The chi gung techniques taught here employ some of their strongest motions where the largest lymph nodes are located; that is, the armpits, the backs of the knees, and the inguinal region. Chi gung&#x2019;s relatively fine muscular expansions and contractions move lymph efficiently through the entire system. These actions, as well as the overall increase in chi that chi gung brings, strengthen the body's immune response.Synovial fluid is found in joints. Chi gung lubricates them, allows joint flexibility, and when functioning normally helps prevent arthritis and rheumatism. From the point of view of Chinese medicine, when &#x201c;wind/damp&#x201d; or physical obstructions (coagulated blood, calcium deposits, and so on) get struck in the joints, the results are not only specific joint problems but a decrease in the flow of chi through the entire body as well. Chi gung works with the synovial fluid by compressing and expanding it, preventing and reversing all sorts of joint problems.

Until that unfortunate incident with the nuke a few years ago....<br><br>But Jake Stonebender and his wife have opened a new Callahan's, Mary's Place, and all the regulars are there: Doc Webster, Fast Eddie the piano player, Long Drink McGonnigle, and of course the usual talking dogs, alcoholic vampires, aliens, and time travelers. Songs will be sung, drinks will be drunk (and drunks will have drinks), puns will be swapped...and as a three-eyed, three-legged, three-armed, three-<i>everythinged </i>alien flashes through space toward the bar, it just might be time to save the world again....<br></p><p>This is the fifth book in the Callahan&#39;s Crosstime Saloon series, a short read that once again brings together the Callahan regulars in a plot that combines the usual group therapy, the best/worst puns ever to see print and epic, world-saving deeds. This time around the gang must save Earth from a decidedly nasty alien, and only group telepathy will do the trick. Spider Robinson, whose cutting wit and keen insights are in full force, takes the opportunity to dive deep into the psyche of his various mainstay characters, making for some darkly intimate reading.Spider Robinson, winner of three Hugos and a Nebula, was born in the Bronx and raised on Long Island, and has been a Canadian resident for 30 years. Holder of a bachelor's degree in English from the State University of New York, he worked as a folksinger and journalist before publishing his first story in <i>Analog </i>in 1973. He now lives with his wife Jeanne Robinson (co-author of the Hugo- and Nebula-winning Stardance trilogy) on an island outside Vancouver, B.C., where they raise and exhibit hopes. <br><br>Eleven of his 31 books are set in Callahan's Place, a fabulous tavern founded by a time traveler, where puns flow as freely as beer, and smell far worse. The most recent is<i> Callahan's Con</i> [Tor July 2003]. He has contributed a regular editorial column, "Future Tense," to Canada's national newspaper,<i> The Globe &amp; Mail</i>, since 1995. In 2000, he released<i> </i>Belaboring the Obvious<i>, </i>a CD of original music with the legendary Amos Garrett ("Midnight at the Oasis") on lead guitar, and in 2001 he was a celebrity judge at the Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam. <br></p><h2>The Aspirin Wars: Money, Medicine, and l00 Years of Rampant Competition</h2><p>Traces the story of aspirin, a wonder drug that has survived virtually unchanged over the course of a century of competition, hucksterism, and corporate skulduggery</p><p>The analogy to a military history is well fulfilled by this literate, compendious chronicle of the marketing of aspirin and its analgesic rivals, starting with the drug's final formulation in the late 1800's and ending with its current ``repositioning'' as a heart-attack preventive. According to Mann (a contributing editor to Science and The Atlantic) and Plummer, here we have a perfect history of medical hype: Aspirin's pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory effects are verifiable and even miraculous, but because its sole constituent, acetylsalicylic acid, had been known and therefore unpatentable in Germany, it became (along with heroin) one of the first drugs sold not by its chemical name but by its ``brand'': Aspirin. The company that sold it was Bayer of Elberfeld, later to become the monolith I.G. Farben. After WW I, when Germany could no longer transact business in many western nations, the brand name became a free-for- all. Among other things, the battle over market share gave rise to such institutions as the roadside billboard and the FDA. Then along came acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil)--and the plot continues to thicken. A well-told tale of greed, business acumen, and ongoing marketing genius that's also a microcosmic history of law, politics, and medical progress in the 20th century. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>The authors detail the history of the marketing of aspirin as a drug from its introduction in 1899 to the present. They carefully researched the business, medical, and legal literature to supplement information obtained through interviews with numerous scientists, businesspeople, and government officials. Some of the events they describe include the activities of Farbenfabriken Bayer in the United States in the early 1900s, Sterling's purchase of the Bayer name of aspirin, the Food and Drug Administration's regulations in labeling and advertising of aspirin, the introduction of competing products such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen, and recent claims that aspirin will reduce the risk of heart attacks for healthy people. The authors also provide numerous literature references. Highly recommended for business and medical collections of public, university, and special libraries.<br><i>- Bruce Slutsky, St. John's Univ.

His books have been sold in thirty-five countries and many have been international bestsellers, including How Proust Can Change Your Life, Essays in Love and The Art of Travel. He is the founder of two social enterprises, the first promoting architecture, Living Architecture (www.living-architecture.co.uk), which gets top architects to build holiday homes for rental by everyone. The second enterprise is The School of Life (www.theschooloflife.com).With allusions to Aristotle, Sartre, Wittgenstein, and Groucho Marx and moving from one historical period to another, the author has plotted an imaginative and microscopically detailed romance. James Wilby reads with grace and understanding. And when he switches from the essay to the story of the two lovers who meet and carry out their romance before our ears, his voice takes on the very flavors of each step of the affair. He gives the truth of an intimate relationship--from complaint to ardor--with sounds all will recognize.

Reprint.</p><p>In <i>The Player of Games</i>, Iain M. Banks presents a distant future that could almost be called the end of history. Humanity has filled the galaxy, and thanks to ultra-high technology everyone has everything they want, no one gets sick, and no one dies. It's a playground society of sports, stellar cruises, parties, and festivals. Jernau Gurgeh, a famed master game player, is looking for something more and finds it when he's invited to a game tournament at a small alien empire. Abruptly Banks veers into different territory. The Empire of Azad is exotic, sensual, and vibrant. It has space battle cruisers, a glowing court--all the stuff of good old science fiction--which appears old-fashioned in contrast to Gurgeh's home. At first it's a relief, but further exploration reveals the empire to be depraved and terrifically unjust. Its defects are gross exaggerations of our own, yet they indict us all the same. Clearly Banks is interested in the idea of a future where everyone can be mature and happy. Yet it's interesting to note that in order to give us this compelling adventure story, he has to return to a more traditional setting. Thoughtful science fiction readers will appreciate the cultural comparisons, and fans of big ideas and action will also be rewarded. <i>--Brooks Peck</i>Iain Banks came to widespread and controversial public notice with the publication of his first novel, THE WASP FACTORY, in 1984. He has since gained enormous popular and critical acclaim for both his mainstream and his science fiction novels.</p><h2>Only You Can Save Mankind (The Johnny Maxwell Trilogy)</h2><p><p>The alien spaceship is in his sights.

This witty memoir, replete with Korda's own line drawings, reads like a novel, as it chronicles the author's transformation from city slicker to full-time country gentleman, complete with tractors, horses, and a leaking roof.</p><p>When he decides to take up residence in an eighteenth-century farmhouse in Dutchess County, ninety miles north of New York City, Korda discovers what country life is really like:</p><ul><li>Owning pigs, more than owning horses, even more than owning the actual house, firmly anchored the Kordas as residents in the eyes of their Pleasant Valley neighbors.</li><li>You may own your land, but without concertina barbed wire, or the 82nd Airborne on patrol, it's impossible to keep people off it!</li><li>It's possible to line up major household repairs over a tuna melt sandwich.</li><li>And everyone in the area is fully aware that Michael "don't know shit about septics."</li></ul><p>The locals are not particularly quick to accept these outsiders, and the couple's earliest interactions with their new neighbors provide constant entertainment, particularly when the Kordas discover that hunting season is a year-round event -- right on their own land! From their closest neighbors, mostly dairy farmers, to their unforgettable caretaker Harold Roe -- whose motto regarding the local flora is "Whack it all back! " -- the residents of Pleasant Valley eventually come to realize that the Kordas are more than mere weekenders.</p><p>Sure to have readers in stitches, this is a book that has universal appeal for all who have ever dreamed of owning that perfect little place to escape to up in the country, or, more boldly, have done it.</p></p><p>Despite the fact that Michael Korda was city born and bred (and, as editor in chief of Simon &amp; Schuster and a bestselling author, part of Manhattan's elite), when he decided it was time to put down roots, he wanted land, trees, and a place in a community with history. The house he bought with his wife, Margaret, in Pleasant Valley, two hours north of New York City, was built when George Washington was president. It came with two barns, 20 acres, a backhoe, a bush hog, a York rake, a dozer blade, a bluff, and a slightly deaf old man named Harold Roe. Since Korda couldn't handle a hammer (plumbing and heating problems in his past merely involved calling the building super and keeping a 20-dollar bill handy), Harold became a permanent fixture, wielding large equipment, destroying the flowers, and showing the couple everything they needed to know about the real country. <p> Pleasant Valley, it turned out, was on the "wrong" side of the Taconic Parkway. It was "red and black plaid hats with earflaps and insulated bib-front overalls country," as opposed to Ralph Lauren estates country. Despite the blue-collar atmosphere (or rather because of it), the Kordas have been there for two decades. Becoming locals hasn't been easy, however. Korda relishes the moments that mark him as an insider--hanging out at the local diner, buying a Harley-Davidson, and most importantly, buying pigs. Pig watching in a place like Pleasant Valley is a truly bonding experience, which Korda describes with his characteristic dry wit: </p><blockquote> Pig watching is not something anybody does in a hurry, as we came to learn. You have to shift your trousers down a bit, loosen up your belt a notch or so, give your belly a little breathing room, light a cigarette if you're a smoker, and look at the pigs for a good long time. Then you sigh, nod your head, and say, "Them's nice pigs, them pigs." Then you look at them some more. </blockquote> You get the idea. A natural raconteur, Korda makes the quirks of living in an old house and the quest for local status in an insular community highly entertaining, and he proves once again that, while he may not be handy with tools, he certainly knows his way around the written word. <i>--Lesley Reed</i><p>Michael Korda is the author of <em>Ulysses S. Grant</em>, <em>Ike</em>, <em>Hero</em>, and <em>Charmed Lives</em>. Educated at Le Rosey in Switzerland and at Magdalen College, Oxford, he served in the Royal Air Force. He took part in the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and on its fiftieth anniversary was awarded the Order of Merit of the People's Republic of Hungary. He and his wife, Margaret, make their home in Dutchess County, New York.</p></p><h2>Zealot</h2><p>About the bookan upshot of scrupulous and painstaking research, zealot: the life and times of jesus of nazareth contrasts the entrenched dogmatic theology and describes the life of jesus as a man rather than a messiah this alluring, picturesque work promises a delectable read to both the believers and agnostics the evocative description of the world in which jesus lived and the role he played are convincingly woven into a fine masterpiece with quoted evidencesin the first century, many jewish peasants and lower classes in palestine were impoverished by the atrocities of roman and jewish upper classesthis book recreates the society, politics, economy and religion at the time of jesus in an enthralling and steady pace jesus is described as a violent revolutionary, passionate man, &#34;zealous&#34; visionary, faith healer who urged his disciples to keep his identity a secret and a common man who couldnt free his people from the early roman brutality in his brief lifetimethe author asserts that the christian church and in particular, st paul obscured the real image of jesus of nazareth and reinvented a holy figure of hope and salvation while the author brings in a different perspective to the story of jesus, he also lets the readers appreciate jesus as the zestful ideologue, for his efforts in restoring peace in his countryread up to know more about the age of zealotry and the authors say on the resurrection three days after crucifixion zealot: the life and times of jesus of nazareth was published on september 2013 by harpercollins india this book is now available in paperbackkey features controversial, it featured in the new york times bestseller list a question by fox tv anchor green on the credibility of this book gained worldwide censure</p><p><p><b>Q&amp;A with Reza Aslan</b></p> <p><strong>Q. Why did you title your biography of Jesus of Nazareth Zealot?</strong></p> <p>A. In Jesus' world, zealot referred to those Jews who adhered to a widely accepted biblical doctrine called zeal. These &#x201c;zealous&#x201d; Jews were strict nationalists who preached the sole sovereignty of God. They wanted to throw off the yoke of Roman occupation and cleanse the Promised Land of all foreign elements. Some zealots resorted to extreme acts of violence against both the Roman authorities and the Jewish &#x2018;collaborators,&#x201d; by which they meant the wealthy Temple priests and the Jewish aristocracy. Others refrained from violence but were no less adamant about establishing the reign of God on earth. There is no evidence that Jesus of Nazareth was himself a violent revolutionary (though his views on the use of violence were more complex than it is often assumed). However, Jesus&#x2019; actions and his teachings about the Kingdom of God clearly indicate that he was a follower of the zealot doctrine, which is why he, like so many zealots before and after him, was ultimately executed by Rome for the crime of sedition.</p> <p><strong>Q. Yours is one of the few popular biographies of Jesus of Nazareth that does not rely on the gospels as your primary source of information for uncovering Jesus&#x2019; life. Why is that? What are your primary sources?</strong></p> <p>A. I certainly rely on the gospels to provide a narrative outline to my biography of Jesus of Nazareth, but my primary source in recreating Jesus&#x2019; life are historical writings about first century Palestine, like the Jewish historian Flavius Josephus, as well as Roman documents of the time. The gospels are incredible texts that provide Christians with a profound framework for living a life in imitation of Christ. The problem, however, is that the gospels are not, nor were they ever meant to be, historical documentations of Jesus&#x2019; life. These are not eyewitness accounts of Jesus&#x2019; words and deeds. They are testimonies of faith composed by communities of faith written many years after the events they describe. In other words, the gospels tell us about Jesus the Christ, not Jesus the man. The gospels are of course extremely useful in revealing how the early Christians viewed Jesus. But they do not tell us much about how Jesus viewed himself. To get to the bottom of that mystery, which is what I try to do in the book, one must sift through the gospel stories to analyze their claims about Jesus in light of the historical facts we know about the time and world in which Jesus lived. Indeed, I believe that if we place Jesus firmly within the social, religious, and political context of the era in which he lived, then, in some ways, his biography writes itself.</p> <p><strong>Q. You write in the book that you became an evangelical Christian in High School, but that after a few years, you abandoned Christianity and returned to the faith of your forefathers: Islam. Why did you decide to make this change and how did it affect how you understood the life and work of Jesus of Nazareth. </strong></p> <p>A. When I was fifteen years old I heard the gospel story for the first time and immediately accepted Jesus into my heart. I had what Christians refer to as &#x201c;an encounter with Christ.&#x201d; I spent the next five years as an evangelical Christian, and even spent some time traveling around the United States spreading the gospel message. But the more I read the Bible &#x2013; especially in college, where I began my formal study of the New Testament &#x2013; the more I uncovered a wide chasm between the Jesus of history and the Jesus I learned about in church. At that same time, through the encouragement of one of my professors, I began to reexamine the faith and traditions of my forefathers and returned to Islam. But the irony is that once I detached my academic study of Jesus from my faith in Christ, I became an even more fervent follower of Jesus of Nazareth. What I mean to say is that I live my life according to the social teachings preached by Jesus two thousand years ago. I take his actions against the powers of his time and his defense of the poor and the weak as a model of behavior for myself. I pray, as a Muslim, alongside my Christian wife, and together we teach our children the values I believe Jesus represents. The man who defied the will of the most powerful empire the world had ever known &#x2013; and lost &#x2013; is so much more real to me than the Jesus I knew as a Christian. So in a way, this book is my attempt to spread the good news of Jesus the man with the same passion that I once applied to spreading the good news of Jesus the Christ.</p> <p><strong>Q. What do you hope readers, especially religious readers, take away from your book?</strong></p> <p>A. My hope is that this book provides readers with a more complete sense of the world in which Jesus lived. We cannot truly understand Jesus&#x2019; words and deeds if we separate them from the religious and political context of his time. Regardless of whether you think of Jesus as a prophet, a teacher, or God incarnate, it is important to remember that he did not live in a vacuum. Whatever else Jesus was, he was, without question, a man of his time. This is true for all of us. The key to understanding who Jesus was and what Jesus meant lies in understanding the times in which he lived. That&#x2019;s what this book does. It drops you in the middle of Jesus&#x2019; world and helps you understand the context out of which he arose and in which preached.</p>Reza Aslan is an internationally acclaimed writer and scholar of religions.

Their relationship is more emptying than fulfilling. Roberta is trying ``to write with her body,'' live out her fiction in various dalliances or by graceless slumming (the two spend a few nights in a shelter for the homeless), while Agustin has, at the book's beginning, killed a woman he barely knows- -earning him instant guilt-racked underground-man status. In what partially is the result of Valenzuela's baroquely overwrought style and partially the translation's clumsiness, this all comes across as unintentionally comic-metafictional shadows dancing with ooh-this-is-naughty peeps at sadomasochism parlors and avant-garde Lower East Side theater: a portrait of New York-as- inferno that a certain kind of intellectually vain foreign writer leaps for like a dog to a bone. And a leaden coat of literary intention, even in dialogue, smothers what little air is left: ``Agustin and I embarked on a rough adventure, a probing investigation, stirring up lots of shit, exposing all the ghosts that we could, entering forbidden areas, searching for the unnameable. I believe we needed an answer and there is no answer, questions always leading to other questions.'' Awfully smug, when it isn't being just plain awful. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

And I should like, for my own part, to add this: that the fragrant, retiring, exquisite flower, which I think she would say is the symbol of New England virtue, is the symbol also of her own modest and delightful art.<br><br>About the Publisher<br><br>Forgotten Books publishes hundreds of thousands of rare and classic books.

Yet to read these marvelous stories is not to study archaic styles but to transport oneself to another time and place, an age of gentility and serenity that no longer exists. Jewett is first and foremost an extraordinary storyteller, and each of these stories is a multi-faceted jewel to be held up to the light and enjoyed. In "Tom's Husband," for example, where the woman in the story assumes the responsibility of running a business, the emphasis is on a gentle irony: "It seems to me that it is something like women's [sic] smoking: It isn't wicked, but it isn't the custom of the country." This sly, tongue-in-cheek humor replaces what could well have been an angry feminist dialectic. "Me King of Folly Island," on the other hand, presents a weak heroine ruled by a stubborn and proud father; Jewett recognizes the reality of existing sexual mores while, simultaneously, questioning their inherent validity. Maintaining an authoritative dignity for her characters, she allows them to examine the intricacies of daily life honestly and unselfconsciously. The seventeen stories in this collection are important for a number of reasons. Most significantly, they present the work of an intelligent and perceptive writer, a woman who is able to capture the essence of an entire age. "Mere was something about the look of the crimson silk shawl in the front yard to make one suspect that the sober customs of the best house in a quiet New England village were all being set at defiance, and once when the mistress of the house came to stand in her own doorway, she wore the pleased but somewhat apprehensive look of a guest." This ability to place a simple gesture in a broader cultural context is rare in itself, and to speak with such subtle eloquence and power is the mark of a true artist. Sarah Ome Jewett deserves to be ranked as one of the great writers of American literature. -- <i>From Independent Publisher</i>There is "no shilly-shallying," as the author might put it, in this collection by Jewett (1849-1909), the admired New England writer who advised Willa Cather, "Write it as it is, don't try to make it like this or that. You can't do it in anybody else's wayyou will have to make a way of your own." Jewett's way, radiantly evident in these 17 stories, is to observe the verities of New England country life in implicit contrast to an encroaching industrial society. Never the sentimentalist, Jewett also exposes, but gently, the conceits and complacencies of provincial existence, as when elderly sisters in a Maine village whose "mother's social position was one of superior altitude" adorn themselves with foolish new hairpieces in "The Dulham Ladies." Her evocation of the natural world is superbly sensitive; equally impressive is her nose for human detail. Jewett was a master whose work (three novels and several collections of stories) Cather rightly called "almost flawless."

Religious conservatives are so adamantly opposed to stem cell research in particular that President Bush issued the first veto of his presidency over a bill that would have provided federal funding for such research.<br><br>Now, in this timely consideration of the nature and rights of human embryos, Robert P. George and Christopher Tollefsen make a persuasive case that we as a society should neither condone nor publicly fund embryonic stem cell research of any kind.<br><br>Typically, right-to-life arguments have been based explicitly on moral and religious grounds. In <i>Embryo</i>, the authors eschew religious arguments and make a purely scientific and philosophical case that the fetus, from the instant of conception, is a human being, with all the moral and political rights inherent in that status. As such, stem cell research that destroys a viable embryo represents the unacceptable taking of a human life.<br><br>There is also no room in their view for a &#x201c;moral dualism&#x201d; that regards being a &#x201c;person&#x201d; as merely a stage in a human life span. An embryo does not exist in a &#x201c;prepersonal&#x201d; stage that does not merit the inviolable rights otherwise ascribed to persons. Instead, the authors argue, the right not to be intentionally killed is inherent in the fact of being a human being, and that status begins at the moment of conception.<br><br>Moreover, just as none should be excluded from moral and legal protections based on race, sex, religion, or ethnicity, none should be excluded on the basis of age, size, or stage of biological development.<br><br>George and Tollefsen fearlessly grapple with the political, scientific, and cultural consequences arising from their position and offer a summary of scientific alternatives to embryonic stem cell research. They conclude that the state has an ethical and moral obligation to protect embryonic human beings in just the same manner that it protects every other human being, and they advocate for embryo adoption&#x2014;the only ethical solution to the problem of spare embryos resulting from in-vitro fertilization.</p></p><p>ROBERT P.

Sixteen months earlier, Noah Benton Markham&#x2019;s life had been jeopardized by the winds and rain of Hurricane Katrina. Trapped in a flooded hospital in New Orleans, Noah depended upon the timely work of seven Illinois Conservation Police officers, and three Louisiana State officers who used flat&#x2013;bottomed boats to rescue Noah and take him to safety.<br><br>Although many New Orleans residents tragically lost their lives in Katrina and its aftermath, Noah&#x2019;s story of rescue is, nevertheless, one of many inspirational tales of heroism from that national disaster. What, then, makes it unique? And why did the story of his rescue end sixteen months <i>after</i> the events of September 2006? The answer is that Noah has the distinction of being one of the <i>youngest</i> residents of New Orleans to be saved from Katrina: when the Illinois and Louisiana police officers entered the hospital where Noah was trapped, he was an embryo, a human being in the very earliest stages of development, frozen with fourteen hundred embryos in canisters of liquid nitrogen.<br><br>Noah&#x2019;s story had a happy ending: Noah&#x2019;s parents were overjoyed those sixteen months later when Noah emerged, via cesarean section, into the light of the wide world. His parents named him in acknowledgment of a resourceful survivor of an earlier flood. His grandmother immediately started phoning relatives with the news: &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a boy!&#x201d; But if those officers had never made it to Noah&#x2019;s hospital, or if they had abandoned those canisters of liquid nitrogen, there can be little doubt that the toll of Katrina would have been fourteen hundred human beings higher than it already was, and Noah, sadly, would have perished before having the opportunity to meet his loving family.<br><br>Let us repeat it: <i>Noah</i> would have perished. For it was Noah who was frozen in one of those canisters; Noah who was brought from New Orleans by boat; Noah who was subsequently implanted into his mother&#x2019;s womb; and Noah who was born on January 16, 2007.<br><br>Noah started this remarkable journey as an embryo, or blastocyst&#x2014;a name for a very early stage of development in a human being&#x2019;s life. Noah continued that journey after implantation into his mother&#x2019;s womb, growing into a fetus and finally an infant. And he will continue, we are confident, to grow into an adolescent and a teenager as he continues along the path to adulthood.<br><br>Noah&#x2019;s progress in these respects is little different from that of any other member of the human race, save for the exertions necessary to save him at the very earliest stage of his life. But in later years, if Noah were to look back to that troubled time in New Orleans and ask himself whether <i>he</i> was rescued that day, whether it was <i>his life</i> that was saved, we believe that there is only one answer he could reasonably give himself: &#x201c;Of course!&#x201d;<br>THE MORAL<br><br>This answer to Noah's question is a mere two words long, yet it contains the key to one of the most morally and politically troubled issues of our day. Is it morally permissible to produce and experiment upon human embryos? Is it morally permissible to destroy human embryos to obtain stem cells for therapeutic purposes? Is it morally permissible to treat human embryos as disposable research material that may be used and destroyed to benefit others? All such questions have the seeds of their answer in these two words. For what Noah would be saying in these two words&#x2014;and his answer is confirmed by all the best science&#x2014;is that <i>human embryos are, from the very beginning, human beings, sharing an identity with, though younger than, the older human beings they will grow up to become</i>.<br><br>Human embryos are not, that is to say, some other type of animal organism, like a dog or cat. Neither are they a part of an organism, like a heart, a kidney, or a skin cell. Nor again are they a disorganized aggregate, a mere clump of cells awaiting some magical transformation. Rather, a human embryo is a whole living member of the species Homo sapiens in the earliest stage of his or her natural development. Unless severely damaged, or denied or deprived of a suitable environment, a human being in the embryonic stage will, by directing its own integral organic functioning, develop himself or herself to the next more mature developmental stage, i.e., the fetal stage. The embryonic, fetal, child, and adolescent stages are stages in the development of a determinate and enduring entity&#x2014;a human being&#x2014;who comes into existence as a single&#x2013;celled organism (the zygote) and develops, if all goes well, into adulthood many years later.<br><br>But does this mean that the human embryo is a human person worthy of full moral respect? Must the early embryo never be used as a mere means for the benefit of others simply because it is a human being? The answer that this book proposes and defends with philosophical arguments through the course of the next several chapters is &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br><br>This &#x201c;yes&#x201d; has many implications, for human life in its earliest stages and most dependent conditions is under threat today as in no other era. The United States, as well as many of the countries of Europe and the developed countries of Asia, are about to move beyond the past thirty years&#x2019; experience of largely unrestricted abortion to a whole new regime of human embryo mass production and experimentation. This new regime requires new rationalizations. Whereas, in the past, the humanity of the fetus, or its moral worth, were ignored or denied in favor of an alleged &#x201c;right to privacy,&#x201d; or considerations of the personal tragedies of women experiencing unwanted pregnancies, what is now proposed is something quite different.<br><br>The production of human embryos, and their destruction in biomedical research, will take place in public labs by teams of scientists. If those scientists and their many supporters have their way, their work will be funded, as it is or soon will be in California, New Jersey, and elsewhere, by the state or by the nation, and in either case by taxpayers&#x2019; money. And if that work bears fruit, then the consequences of this research will be felt throughout the world of medicine and the pharmaceutical industry. (1) It will be virtually impossible for those with grave moral objections to such experimentation to remain free from entanglement in it: their money will pay for labs in their universities, and their doctors will routinely use the results of embryo&#x2013;destructive research.<br><br>For example, in 2004, a ballot initiative known as Proposition 71 was passed in California. This referendum was supported by Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Republican governor of the state. Its backers contributed a tremendous amount of money, and much propaganda, to ensure its passage. The measure promises that up to $3.1 billion will be spent on embryo&#x2013;destructive research over the next ten years. Even supporters of the research have pointed out that Proposition 71 threatens to bring about a largely unregulated industry that will inevitably line the pockets of a relative few. (2) But such objections, important as they are, ignore what this industry is centrally about: the production and destruction of human beings in the earliest stage of development. This basic truth is lost amidst discussion of &#x201c;therapeutic cloning&#x201d; or &#x201c;Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer (SCNT),&#x201d; euphemisms and technicalities designed to obscure rather than clarify. And amidst the promises of boundless health benefits from this research, it can become tempting to lose sight of all that is really at stake. But consider the following analogy.<br><br>Suppose that a movement arose to obtain transplantable organs by killing mentally retarded infants. Would the controversy that would inevitably erupt over this be best characterized as a debate about organ transplantation? Would anyone accept as a legitimate description the phrase <i>therapeutic organ harvesting</i>? Surely not: the dispute would best be characterized&#x2014;and in any decent society it would be characterized&#x2014;as a debate about the ethics of killing retarded children in order to obtain their organs. (Indeed, in a truly decent society, the question would not arise at all!)<br><br>Nor would the public, we submit, accept arguments for the practice that turned on considerations about how many gravely ill nonretarded people could be saved by extracting a heart, two kidneys, a liver, etc., from each retarded child. For the threshold question would be whether it is unjust to relegate a certain class of human beings&#x2014;the retarded&#x2014;to the status of objects that can be killed and dissected to benefit others. Similarly, there would be something almost obscene in worrying about underregulation of these procedures.<br><br>By the same token, we should not be speaking, as in California, in terms of a debate about embryonic stem cell research; nor is the main moral issue that of adequate governmental oversight. No one would object to the use of embryonic stem cells in biomedical research or therapy if they could be derived without killing or in any way wronging the embryos. Nor would anyone object to using such cells if they could be obtained using embryos lost in spontaneous abortions. The point of the controversy is the ethics of deliberately destroying human embryos for the purpose of producing stem cells. The threshold question is whether it is unjust to kill members of a certain class of human beings&#x2014;those in the embryonic stage of development&#x2014;to benefit others. Thus we return to the significance of the story of Noah and the flood.<br>THE EMBRYO TECHNOLOGIES OF TODAY AND TOMORROW<br><br>What is it, though, that is currently being done with embryos, or that can currently be done with embryos, or that might one day be done with ...</p><h2>Basketry Today: With Materials From Nature</h2><p>Step-by-step photographs demonstrate the techniques of plain weaving, twining, and coiling and detailed instructions for specific projects lead to stylish, colorful baskets</p><p></p><h2>Prior Bad Acts: A Novel (Sam Kovac and Nikki Liska)</h2><p><i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Tami Hoag returns with a thriller that begins with a shocking crime scene you&#x2019;ll never forget and follows two relentless detectives on a manhunt that ends in a chilling confrontation with the essence of human evil.<br><br>It was a crime so brutal, it changed the lives of even the most hardened homicide cops.

Both traits had served him well in the courtroom with juries, not always so well in judges' chambers. He was tall, broad shouldered, athletic, with a thick shock of black-Irish hair now threaded with silver. Forty-five years old, Logan had spent twenty of those years in the criminal court system. It was a wonder he hadn't gone entirely white.<br><br>"I'm sorry," said the defense attorney, his sarcasm belying the expression of shock. "Did I miss something? When were we suddenly transported to the Dark Ages? Aren't the accused in this country still innocent until proven guilty?"<br><br>Logan rolled his eyes. "Oh, for Christ's sake, Scott, could you spare us the act? We're all adults. We all know each other. We all know you're full of shit. Could you spare us the demonstration?"<br><br>"Mr. Logan . . ."<br><br>Judge Carey Moore gave him a level look. She had known Chris Logan since they had both cut their teeth toiling as public defenders--a job neither of them had the temperament for. They had moved on to the county attorney's office as quickly as they could, and both had made their names in the courtroom, prosecuting everything from petty theft to rape to murder.<br><br>Sitting in the other chair across from her desk was another cog in the public defender's machine. Kenny Scott had gone in that door and had never come out, which made him either a saint battling for justice for the socially disadvantaged or a pathetic excuse for an attorney, unable to rise out of anonymity and go on to private practice. Having had him in her courtroom numerous times, Carey suspected the latter.<br><br>He looked at Carey now with the eyes of a mouse in a room full of cats. Perspiring, nervous, ready to run, scrambling mentally. He was a small man whose suits never fit--too big in the shoulders, too long in the sleeves--which somehow emphasized the impression that he was overwhelmed by his job or by life in general.<br><br>By the luck of the draw, he had gotten stuck with the job of defending the most hated man in Minneapolis, if not the entire state: a drifter named Karl Dahl, accused of the most heinous murders Carey had encountered in her career.<br><br>The scene had been so gruesome, one of the uniformed officers who had responded to the original call had suffered a heart attack and had subsequently retired from the force. The lead homicide detective had been so affected by the case, he had eventually been removed from the rotation and put on a desk job, pending the completion of psychiatric counseling.<br><br>"Your Honor, you can't allow Mr. Logan to circumvent the rules of law," Scott said. "Prior bad acts are inadmissible--"<br><br>"Unless they establish a pattern of behavior," Logan argued loudly. He had the fierce expression of an eagle.<br><br>Kenny Scott looked like he wanted nothing more than to bolt from the office and run for his life, but to his credit, he stayed in his seat.<br><br>"Mr. Dahl's previous offenses have nothing to do with this case," he said. "Criminal trespass? That hardly establishes him as a violent offender."<br><br>Logan glared at him. "What about possession of child pornography? What about breaking and entering? Window peeping? Indecent exposure?"<br><br>"He never killed anyone with his penis," Scott said.<br><br>"It's an escalating pattern of behavior," Logan argued. "That's what these pervs do. They start small and work their way up. First they get their jollies whacking off while they look at little kids in their underwear in the JCPenney catalog. When that doesn't do it for them anymore, they move on to window peeping, then to exposing themselves. Next they need to have physical contact--"<br><br>"And they jump from weenie wagging to evisceration?" Scott said. "That's absurd."<br><br>He turned back toward Carey. "Your Honor, there is nothing violent in Karl Dahl's record. The information regarding his prior convictions would be prejudicial and inflammatory. The jury would be ready to convict him based on Mr. Logan's theory, not fact, not evidence."<br><br>Logan ticked his facts off on his fingers. "We have his fingerprints at the scene. We have a complaint filed by one of the neighbors, reporting him for looking in her windows. We know he knew the victims, that he'd been hanging around the neighborhood. He had the victim's necklace in his possession at the time of his arrest--"<br><br>"He was doing odd jobs," Scott said. "He admits to having been in the Haas home the day of the murders.&nbsp; Mrs. Haas paid him thirty-five dollars to install some curtain rods. He stole a cheap necklace. Big deal. Other than the one neighbor, no one in the neighborhood had any complaint against him."<br><br>Logan rolled his eyes dramatically. "Every one of them said the guy was strange, that he gave them the creeps--"<br><br>"That's not against the law--"<br><br>"Good thing for you," Logan muttered.<br><br>Carey warned him again. "Mr. Logan . . ."<br><br>He gave her a familiar look from under the heavy dark eyebrows. "An eyewitness puts him at the scene--"<br><br>"At least five hours after the murders had been committed," Scott pointed out.<br><br>"Coming back to review his work," Logan said.<br><br>"That doesn't make any sense. Coming back that late in the day, when people would be arriving home from work--"<br><br>"So he was back to kill the father and the oldest kid--"<br><br>"Just where did you get your crystal ball, Logan?" Scott asked. "Maybe we can all run out and get one. Maybe the state can buy them in bulk and distribute them to every law enforcement agency--"<br><br>Carey arched a brow in disapproval. "Put the sarcasm away, Mr. Scott."<br><br>Logan jumped in again. "This is a clear exception to the rule, Your Honor. The man is a serial killer at the front end of his career. If we don't stop him now--"<br><br>Carey held up a hand to stave off any more arguments. Her head ached as if it had been crushed by a millstone. Through law school and the years working her way up the ranks, her goal had been to sit in these chambers, to wear the robes, to be a judge.<br><br>At that moment, she wished she had listened to her grandmother and honed her secretarial skills as a fallback should she not land a suitable husband.<br><br>Presiding over felony proceedings was a responsibility she had never taken lightly. Because she'd come from a successful career as a prosecuting attorney, people expected her to be biased toward the prosecution--an expectation she had worked hard to dispel.<br><br>As a prosecutor it had been her job to vigorously pursue the conviction of defendants. As a judge, her job was to preside fairly, to take no sides, to keep the scales of justice in balance so that every verdict was reached based solely on the relevant facts and evidence presented.<br><br>Carey couldn't take sides, no matter what her personal feelings might be. In this case she had her work cut out. Two children had been brutalized, tortured, murdered, left hanging by their necks from the ceiling of a dank basement.<br><br>She was a mother herself. The idea of someone harming her daughter evoked an emotion so strong there were no words adequate to describe it. She had viewed the crime scene photos and the videotape. The images haunted her.<br><br>The children's foster mother had been raped, sodomized, tortured, her body sliced open from throat to groin. The coroner had determined that the woman had died first, though there was no way of knowing what might have taken place before her very eyes prior to her death. She might have been made to watch while unspeakable acts were committed on the children. The children might have been made to watch while unspeakable acts were committed on her. Either way, a nightmare from the darkest, most primal, fear-filled corner of the human mind.<br><br>But as a judge, Carey couldn't attach those atrocities to the defendant on trial before her. Her decision on the matter before her now couldn't be swayed by her own fears or disgust. She couldn't worry how people would react to her ruling. A criminal trial was not a popularity contest.<br><br>A fine theory, at least.<br><br>She took a breath and sighed, the weight of the matter pressing down on her. The attorneys watched her. Kenny Scott looked like he was waiting for her to pronounce sentence on him. Logan's impatience was palpable. He stared at her as if he believed he could influence her mind by sheer dint of will.<br><br>Carey quelled the sick feeling in her stomach. <i>Move forward. Get it over with</i>.<br><br>"I've read your briefs, gentlemen," she said. "And I'm well aware of the impact my decision will have on this case. I can guarantee neither of you would want to be sitting in this chair right now."<br><br>Logan would have argued that, she knew. Bias was a way of life for him. "Right with might" was his motto. If he believed something, then it was so--no arguments. But he held his tongue, held his breath, poised to leap out of his chair. Carey met his gaze full-on.<br><br>"I don't see an exception here," she said.<br><br>Logan opened his mouth, ready to rebut.<br><br>"You'll allow me to finish, Mr. Logan."<br><br>His face was flushed red with anger. He looked at the wall.<br><br>"Mr. Dahl's prior acts may point in a particular direction, suggesting a possible path of future criminal behavior," she said. "However, he has no history of violent crimes, and this court can't foresee what Mr. Dahl might do in months or years to come. At any rate, we aren't allowed to try people for crimes they have yet to commit."<br><br>"Your Honor," Logan said, his voice tight from holding back the need to shout. "Violent criminals are made over time. Mr. Dahl's record--"<br><br>"Is inadmissible," Carey said.<br><br>If people could have been put away for crimes they had yet to commit, Chris Logan would have been led away in handcuffs. The fury in his eyes was murderous.<br><br>Kenny Scott barely contained himself from leaping out of his chair and doing a victory dance. Carey stared at him, and he slouched back down and swallowed the joy of his victory. He wouldn't think it was such a good thing after the news hit the press, Carey thought.<br><br>People generally demonstrated less loathing for public defenders than headline defense attorneys. They were, after all, civil servants toiling away for low wages, devoting their lives to help the unfortunate. But as soon as her ruling was made public, Kenny Scott would suddenly become an enemy of the state. Defending the indigent was one thing. Getting an accused murderer off was quite another.<br><br>"Your Honor," Scott said, ready to strike while the iron was hot. "In view of your ruling, I don't see that the prosecution has enough evidence to support the indictment--"<br><br>Logan came out of his chair.<br><br>Eyes popping, Scott looked at the man looming over him. "I move that the charges be dismissed," he said, talking as fast as he could, trying to get all the words out of his mouth before Logan could grab him by the throat and crush his larynx.<br><br>"Motion denied," Carey said with a calm that belied her inner tension. "Sit down, Mr. Logan, or I'll have you removed."<br><br>Logan glared at her, defiant. He didn't sit, but he moved away from Kenny Scott and went over by the wall, his hands jammed at his waist, nostrils flaring as he tried to gather himself.<br><br>"But Your Honor," Scott argued, "the state has no direct evidence linking my client to the crimes. No fingerprints on the murder weapons--"<br><br>"He wiped them clean," Logan growled.<br><br>"No blood evidence on his clothes--"<br><br>"So he ditched the clothes."<br><br>"No DNA evidence--"<br><br>"He used a condom--"<br><br>"Not so much as a hair--"<br><br>"The guy doesn't have any," Logan snapped. "He shaves his body clean so he won't leave any hairs behind. What does that tell you?"<br><br>"He does it for hygiene reasons," Scott said. "The guy's a transient. He doesn't want to pick up lice."<br><br>Logan made a rude sound and rolled his eyes dramatically.<br><br>Carey turned to him. "Well, Mr. Logan? What do you have on Mr. Dahl?"<br><br>"I'm supposed to lay out my entire case in front of him?" Logan said, incredulous.<br><br>"Do you have a case to lay out?"<br><br>"He's got conjecture, supposition, and coincidence," Scott said.<br><br>"I've got a grand jury indictment," Logan said.<br><br>"And the Cracker Jack box it came in?"<br><br>"It's good to know you have so much respect for our criminal justice system, Mr. Scott," Carey said without humor.<br><br>Scott stammered, tripping backward, trying to cover his mistake. Carey held up a hand to forestall the attempt. She wished the earth would open and swallow Kenny Scott and Chris Logan and this entire nightmare case.<br><br>"The indictment stands," she said. "A jury can decide if the state has a case strong enough to convict your client, Mr. Scott."<br><br>She gave Logan a look she knew he recognized from their years together on the same side of the bar. "And if you don't, Mr. Logan . . . God help you."<br><br>She rose behind her desk and nodded toward the door. "Gentlemen . . ."<br><br>Kenny Scott bounced up from his seat. "But Your Honor, shouldn't we revisit the idea of bail?"<br><br>No."<br><br>"But my client--"<br><br>"Should consider himself damned lucky to have a guarded building between himself and the public," she said. "Considering the climate of the community, bail would not be in your client's best interest. <br><br>Quit while you're ahead, Mr. Scott."<br><br>Scott bobbed and nodded. "Yes, ma'am."<br><br>"Don't call me ma'am."<br><br>"No. I'm sorry, Your Honor. I meant no disrespect."<br><br>"Please leave."<br><br>"Yes, ma-- Of course."<br><br>He held up his hands as if to concede his stupidity, then fumbled to grab his briefcase and nearly tripped himself on his way out the door.<br><br>Logan remained for a moment but didn't say a word. He didn't need to. Carey knew exactly what was going through his mind. Then he huffed a sigh and walked out like a man with a purpose.<br><br>The bottle of scotch in his bottom right-hand desk drawer.<br><br>"Have one for me," she muttered.</p><h2>Colonial Living</h2><p>Colonial Living, Edwin Tunis's vigorous re-creation of 17th- and 18th-century America, examines the everyday lives of those sturdy men and women who transplanted European culture to the New World.<br>Long research and love for his subject gave Tunis an intimate knowledge of the details of colonial experience, from earliest coastal settlement to the revolutionary era.

He lives in Arizona.<br><br> <b>Thomas Perry </b>is the highly acclaimed author of twenty novels, including the Edgar Award�&#x2013;winning <i>The Butcher&#x2019;s Boy</i> and the seven novels in the popular Jane Whitefield series, most recently <i>Poison Flower</i>. He has also been a writer and/or producer for several television series, including <i>Simon &amp; Simon</i>, <i>21 Jump Street</i>, and <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i>. He lives in Southern California.It could be the switch in coauthors (veteran mystery writer Perry takes over for Grant Blackwood), or the rather nifty story (an excavation of a historical site leads to a modern-day quest to find the lost treasure of Attila the Hun), but either way the fourth Fargo adventure is the best of the series so far. Danger abounds, of course, but it&#x2019;s the characters who sell the story. Sam and Remi Fargo, the husband-and-wife treasure hunters and globe-trotting adventurers, are likable and gutsy, not merely Indiana Jones&#x2013;style stereotypes. The story moves at a brisk clip, leaping from location to location, with an assortment of colorful villains (including one extremely unpleasant fella who thinks he&#x2019;s descended from Attila) and plenty of verbal interplay between the two leads. Cussler seems to have entered the period in his lengthy career where he relies heavily on his collaborators&#x2014;and Perry is an A-lister&#x2014;but some very good books have been appearing with his name on them, and this is one his fans won&#x2019;t want to miss. --David Pitt</p><h2>Theory of International Politics</h2><p>The seminal text on neorealist analysis! From Theory of International Politics: National politics is the realm of authority, of administration, and of law. International politics is the realm of power, of struggle, and of accommodation. . . . States, like people, are insecure in proportion to the extent of their freedom. If freedom is wanted, insecurity must be accepted. Organizations that establish relations of authority and control may increase security as they decrease freedom. If might does not make right, whether among people or states, then some institution or agency has intervened to lift them out of nature s realm. The more influential the agency, the stronger the desire to control it becomes. In contrast, units in an anarchic order act for their own sakes and not for the sake of preserving an organization and furthering their fortunes within it. Force is used for one s own interest. In the absence of organization, people or states are free to leave one another alone. Even when they do not do so, they are better able, in the absence of the politics of the organization, to concentrate on the politics of the problem and to aim for a minimum agreement that will permit their separate existence rather than a maximum agreement for the sake of maintaining unity. If might decides, then bloody struggles over right can more easily be avoided.<p> TABLE OF CONTENTS: 1. Laws and Theories 2. Reductionist Theories 3. Systemic Approaches and Theories 4.

Colorful, one-dimensional drawings fill the pages from edge to edge and the brief text of two or three sentences is located on alternate pages. A fact section and contemporary photographs complete the brief volume. This title's brevity might encourage readers to explore additional sources and perhaps inspire them to listen to and learn more about jazz music.

Weaving informative discussions of bee biology with colorful anecdotes, personal insights, and beautiful photos, Thomas Seeley describes the history and science behind this lost pastime and how anyone can do it. The bee hunter&#x2019;s reward is a thrilling encounter with nature that challenges mind and body while also giving insights into the remarkable behavior of honey bees living in the wild. Whether you&#x2019;re a bee enthusiast or just curious about the natural world, this book is the ideal companion for newcomers to bee hunting and a rare treat for armchair naturalists.</p></p><p><p>"<i>Following the Wild Bees</i> is scientific natural history at its very best: original, authentic, and exciting. It is at the same time science, science history, adventure, sport, and treasure hunting."<b>--Edward O. Wilson, Harvard University</b></p><p>"As charming a book as I've read in ages, <i>Following the Wild Bees</i> engages with the natural world in precisely the same way that dozens of generations of bee hunters have done before. My advice would be, make a beeline for the bookstore."<b>--Bill McKibben, author of <i>Oil and Honey</i></b></p><p>"Great adventure, true science, lost art. Bee hunting is older even than beekeeping, yet has never been described in such careful detail. Seeley draws from his whole life of honey bee study to simply and eloquently describe the bee hunter's craft, and the honey bee's foraging behavior. He fully shares the skills you'll need--capturing, baiting, releasing, marking, timing, and moving a company of bees--to pursue the fascinating outdoor sport of finding the secret homes of wild honey bee colonies."<b>--Kim Flottum, editor of <i>Bee Culture</i> magazine</b></p><p>"This unique book is about using the art of bee lining to find honey bee colonies living in hollow trees, something the author has done for forty years. It is also about honey bees, the pleasure of connecting with nature, the sport given by hunting, and how a hunt need not end in a kill to be exhilarating. The chase is enough."<b>--Francis L. W. Ratnieks, University of Sussex</b></p><p>"This inspiring, elegantly written book is much more than a riveting set of instructions for finding wild honey bee colonies nesting in tree cavities. It is a prescription for what ails us. Seely leads us on a hunt for sanity, and the best part is that the hunt ends in reverence rather than destruction. This book is a gift to humanity and a homage to bees."<b>--Marla Spivak, University of Minnesota</b></p><p>"A special delight. There is no better guide to bee hunting than Seeley. Here, he draws on his extensive groundbreaking research into bee behavior, both in the lab and in the field. Following wild honey bees is Seeley's passion, and also his scientific reward--and it shows on every page of this wonderful book."<b>--Bernd Heinrich, author of <i>The Homing Instinct: Meaning and Mystery in Animal Migration</i></b></p><p>"Like Thoreau, Seeley advises us to slow down, take our time, and enjoy the natural world through a calm and contemplative approach. This is a lovely book, beautifully written and filled with Seeley's usual clarity and enthusiasm for bees."<b>--Mark L. Winston, author of <i>Bee Time: Lessons from the Hive</i></b></p><b>Thomas D.

My parents were both professors at the University of North Carolina: my mom is a classicist (which means she knows everything you could ever imagine about myths, Latin, and words) and my dad teaches Shakespeare (which means I&#x2019;d seen&nbsp; <i>As You Like It</i>&nbsp;about five times by the age of 18.) I have one brother, who is a musician and lives in California with his son and his wife, an artist who designed my personal website. (Thanks, Mariangeles!) <br> <br> "I&#x2019;ve been writing, in one way or another, for as long as I can remember. I was always a big reader, mostly because my parents were. I used to get frustrated with my mom because she bought me books for Christmas when what I really wanted were the gifts my friends got, things like sweaters and jewelry. But I did love to read. When I was eight or nine my parents gave me an old manual typewriter and a little desk in the corner of our den, and I&#x2019;d sit there and type up my stories. I was the kind of kid that people always sighed over and said, "She has such a wild imagination," which usually meant "I wish Sarah would try to stick to the truth." I have a tendency to embellish: I think it&#x2019;s just a weakness of fiction writers. Once you learn how to make a story better, it&#x2019;s hard not to do it all the time. <br> <br> "In high school, I was lucky enough to have a big group of girlfriends that have really inspired a lot of the stories in my books. I&#x2019;m still close with my friends from that time, so it&#x2019;s never very hard to put myself back into that place, that voice. Also it doesn&#x2019;t hurt to still be living in my hometown, where it&#x2019;s a given that I&#x2019;ll bump into people I had homeroom with, or guys I had big crushes on, while I&#x2019;m pumping gas or buying stamps. It makes it hard to leave high school behind entirely, which is a good or bad thing depending on what day you ask me. I attended college at UNC, where I studied creative writing and graduated with a degree in English. (Which means I can quote small parts of many Great Works. Comes in handy occasionally, like at cocktail parties.) I&#x2019;d been on the five-and-a-half year college plan, and when I graduated my parents were hoping I&#x2019;d settle down and get a Real Job so they could stop worrying about me. But instead of doing the whole resume/pantyhose thing, I decided to stick to my job waiting tables at the world famous Flying Burrito Restaurant and try to publish a novel. At the time, I had only one very bad book I&#x2019;d written my senior year of college and the beginnings of another one. Luckily, my family was supportive and I spent a few years living in a ramshackle little house where I wrote during the day and did the restaurant thing at night. <br> <br> "Three years after graduating, I sold my first book,&nbsp; <b>That Summer</b>, but it wasn&#x2019;t until a year after that that I got offered a teaching job and left waitressing for good. I still miss it sometimes, though. It was a great job for a writer. Endless conversations to eavesdrop, tons of material, and fast money without ever taking work home. Plus, free Mexican food, the best perk of all. Now, I&#x2019;ve published four books, all for young adults. I never really intended to be YA writer, but the second book I showed my agent she thought had a strong teenage voice, so she sent it off to an editor at Orchard Books, who bought it. Even though it was in a way accidental, I&#x2019;ve found that writing for teens suits me. I do short stories, and other novels, that are for an older audience, but again and again I am brought back to the stories of high school. Maybe it&#x2019;s because so much happened to me then that I&#x2019;m not finished yet telling everything. My senior quote was from Pink Floyd (okay, I was a bit of a burnout---I spent a lot of time in the parking lot, whatever, let&#x2019;s move on) and it pretty much summed up my future, although I didn&#x2019;t know it at the time. It was: "The time is gone, the song is over, thought I&#x2019;d something more to say." It turns out that I did. <br> <br> "The books I read when I was teenager, the good ones anyway, have stuck more in my mind than anything since. I still love books, but while I couldn&#x2019;t tell you complete plots of novels I read even six months ago, I do remember even the smallest descriptive details from Lois Lowry&#x2019;s&nbsp; <b>A Summer to Die</b>&nbsp;or Judy Blume&#x2019;s&nbsp; <b>Are You There God? It&#x2019;s Me, Margaret</b>. I think it was because back then books were still somewhat new to me, and when I found an author who seemed to say just what I was feeling, it really struck me and resonated. I hope that my books do that for the people who read them: I think it&#x2019;s the best thing to which any writer can aspire. Now, I teach writing at UNC-Chapel Hill, where I&#x2019;m lucky enough to see my students find their own voice, the way I did in the same program there not so long ago. Teaching is great for me, because I get to show people how writing can really change the way you see not only yourself but the world. I&#x2019;ve found in my own life that if my writing isn&#x2019;t going well, not much else will. It is the one constant, the key to everything else. <br> <br> "As far as my other life, my non-writing life, I live in the country with my husband, some lizards, and two dogs who are completely spoiled and rule me completely. I like to work in my garden---although I have not yet perfected the art of keeping everything alive----and, in my weaker moments, shop. I have a bit of an addiction to the Gap clearance rack, to be honest. I have this strange need to buy huge quantities of black pants. How many pairs of black pants does one person need? (Obviously for me, the answer is 11 and counting. But I digress.) What else can I tell you? I love Starbucks mochas but they make me way hyper. I subscribe to too many magazines. I make a mean bean salad. I could go on, but the truth is, my books are much more exciting than I am, and that&#x2019;s a good thing. It&#x2019;s always more fun to make stuff up anyway." <br><b>Sarah Dessen</b>&nbsp;is the author of thirteen novels, which include the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestsellers&nbsp;<i>The Moon and More</i>,&nbsp;<i>What Happened to Goodbye</i>,&nbsp;<i>Along for the Ride</i>,&nbsp;<i>Lock and Key</i>,&nbsp;<i>Just Listen</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Truth About Forever</i>, and&nbsp;<i>This Lullaby</i>.

The<em> </em>chronicle of&nbsp;an ordinary woman&#x2019;s struggle for dignity and her rights in a textile mill, <em>The Last Ballad</em> is a moving tale of courage in the face of oppression and injustice, with the emotional power of Ron Rash&#x2019;s <em>Serena</em>, Dennis Lehane&#x2019;s <em>The Given Day</em>, and the unforgettable films <em>Norma Rae</em> and <em>Silkwood.</em></p><p>Twelve times a week, twenty-eight-year-old Ella May Wiggins makes the two-mile trek to and from her job on the night shift at American Mill No. 2 in Bessemer City, North Carolina. The insular community considers the mill&#x2019;s owners&#x2014;the newly arrived Goldberg brothers&#x2014;white but not American and expects them to pay Ella May and other workers less because they toil alongside African Americans like Violet, Ella May&#x2019;s best friend. While the dirty, hazardous job at the mill earns Ella May a paltry nine dollars for seventy-two hours of work each week, it&#x2019;s the only opportunity she has. Her no-good husband, John, has run off again, and she must keep her four young children alive with whatever work she can find.</p><p>When the union leaflets begin circulating, Ella May has a taste of hope, a yearning for the better life the organizers promise. But the mill owners, backed by other nefarious forces, claim the union is nothing but a front for the Bolshevik menace sweeping across Europe. To maintain their control, the owners will use every means in their power, including bloodshed, to prevent workers from banding together. On the night of the county&#x2019;s biggest rally, Ella May, weighing the costs of her choice, makes up her mind to join the movement&#x2014;a decision that will have lasting consequences for her children, her friends, her town&#x2014;indeed all that she loves.</p><p>Seventy-five years later, Ella May&#x2019;s daughter Lilly, now an elderly woman, tells her nephew about his grandmother and the events that transformed their family. Illuminating the most painful corners of their history, she reveals, for the first time, the tragedy that befell Ella May after that fateful union meeting in 1929.</p><p>Intertwining myriad voices, Wiley Cash brings to life the heartbreak and bravery of the now forgotten struggle of the labor movement in early twentieth-century America&#x2014;and pays tribute to the thousands of heroic women and men who risked their lives to win basic rights for all workers. Lyrical, heartbreaking, and haunting, this eloquent novel confirms Wiley Cash&#x2019;s place among our nation&#x2019;s finest writers.</p><p></p></p><p><p>Wiley Cash is the award-winning and <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>A Land More Kind Than Home</em> and the acclaimed <em>This Dark Road to Mercy</em>.

It is an excellent resource for practitioners, academics, and students of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, offering everything one needs to know about treating the major anxiety and mood disorders in one practical volume. Through every chapter, the appendices, and the CD-ROM, the authors go the extra mile to ensure comprehensive research coverage; explicate practical applications; and provide more than the standard collection of therapist tools, forms, and assessments. The authors provide current, far-reaching research on each disorder in accessible, engaging language. Rather than emphasizing only one CBT approach, they review a range of treatment approaches (e.g., cognitive, behavioral, acceptance-based) within CBT for each disorder. They then compile every resource clinicians need at their fingertips to comprehensively assess and treat clients with a range of anxiety and mood disorders. The reproducible assessment forms and clinical hand-outs and worksheets alone make the book worth purchasing, but the authors offer so much more....I not only use <i>Treatment Plans and Interventions for Depression and Anxiety Disorders</i> regularly in practice myself, but when I read it I immediately switched to this text for my graduate level CBT courseand my students all thanked me! I have never read such an all-inclusive and accessible volume on treatment approaches that will serve the majority of clients most CBT clinicians encounter. I give it my highest recommendation, and I laud the authors for the labor they devoted to this worka work that promises to make life easier for clinicians while improving their understanding of CBT principles and the quality of their evidence-based practices.&#x201d;, <i>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Book Reviews</i> Published On: 2014-05-21<br><br>"Provides exactly what it suggestsa reference for clinicians about methods and practical interventions for a number of psychological disorders...This manual provides an excellent reference guide for any graduate student or therapist considering using CBT in a short-term treatment plan.", <i>Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapy</i> Published On: 2001-07-03</p><h2>The Disaster Diaries: One Man&#39;s Quest to Learn Everything Necessary to Survive the Apocalypse</h2><p><b>Gain the basic skills you'd need to live through a cataclysmic event&#x2014;one humbling and angst-filled lesson at a time</b><br>&nbsp;<br>We're inundated daily with images of chaos and catastrophe from movies, books, and the nightly news. When Sam Sheridan became a father, these tales of disaster became impossible to ignore, and he was beset with nightmares about being unable to protect his son. He soon realized, however, that each possible doomsday scenario required a different skillset, and in order to really survive the apocalypse, he'd have to learn everything, from starting a fire to stealing a car, learning to fight with a knife, and even building an igloo.

Sheridan uncovers survival skills (first aid, hunting in the wilderness, firing a gun) as well as some craftier tricks (hot-wiring a car, constructing an igloo). But <i>The Disaster Diaries </i>isn't instructional. The apocalypse schemes serve as a lens that allows Sheridan to explore the limits of the human body and psyche and how physical and mental strength are inexplicably linked... at least <b>when the apocalypse does arrive, I can take comfort that Sam Sheridan will survive, to continue the existence of the human race and smartly researched nonfiction books</b>."<br>&#x2014;Grantland<br><br>"Sheridan understands exactly what he is doing.

The author, a Harvard grad who's been an EMT, a merchant marine, and a boxer&#x2014;among many other adventurous endeavors&#x2014;takes us step by step through the process, beginning with the fundamentals: getting physically fit and learning how to handle stress. From there we move, in logical sequence, to more intricate tasks: preparing an emergency disaster kit, learning to protect ourselves in the event of violent encounters (hand-to-hand combat training; learning how to fire a gun), acquiring basic medical skills, planning a strategy to get out of the disaster area, and so on. But this is no mere guide to surviving disaster; it's also the author's personal account of learning to prepare for catastrophe.

She was born into a world where being a girl is a dangerous thing. In the mountains of Guerrero, Mexico, women must fend for themselves, as their men have left to seek opportunities elsewhere. Here in the shadow of the drug war, bodies turn up on the outskirts of the village to be taken back to the earth by scorpions and snakes. School is held sporadically, when a volunteer can be coerced away from the big city for a semester. In Guerrero the drug lords are kings, and mothers disguise their daughters as sons, or when that fails they &#x201c;make them ugly&#x201d; &#x2013; cropping their hair, blackening their teeth- anything to protect them from the rapacious grasp of the cartels. And when the black SUVs roll through town, Ladydi and her friends burrow into holes in their backyards like animals, tucked safely out of sight.<br>&nbsp;<br>While her mother waits in vain for her husband&#x2019;s return, Ladydi and her friends dream of a future that holds more promise than mere survival, finding humor, solidarity and fun in the face of so much tragedy. When Ladydi is offered work as a nanny for a wealthy family in Acapulco, she seizes the chance, and finds her first taste of love with a young caretaker there. But when a local murder tied to the cartel implicates a friend, Ladydi&#x2019;s future takes a dark turn. Despite the odds against her, this spirited heroine&#x2019;s resilience and resolve bring hope to otherwise heartbreaking conditions.<br>&nbsp;<br>An illuminating and affecting portrait of women in rural Mexico, and a stunning exploration of the hidden consequences of an unjust war, <i>Prayers for the Stolen</i> is an unforgettable story of friendship, family, and determination.</p><p><p><b>On Writing <i>Prayers for the Stolen</i></b></p> <p>In Mexico today women are stolen off the street or taken from their houses at gunpoint. Some women never return home from their work place, a party or from walking to the corner. They are all young and poor and pretty. </p> <p>I have spent over ten years listening to women affected by Mexico&#x2019;s violence as I was interested in writing about women in Mexico&#x2019;s drug culture. This was a logical step for me after having written the novel <i>A True Story Based on Lies</i>, which is about the mistreatment of servants in Mexico. I interviewed the girlfriends, wives and daughters of drug traffickers and quickly came to realize that Mexico is a warren of hidden women. They hide in places that look like supermarkets or grocery stores on the outside, but that are really hiding places with false fa�ades; in the basements of convents, where women live with their children and have not seen daylight for years; and in privately-owned hotels that are rented by the government -- a surreal, Third World concept of a Witness Protection Program. </p> <p>In rural Mexico, the poorest families dig holes in their cornfields. This is how they hide their women from traffickers. It is as if they planted their daughters in the earth so they would not be stolen. </p> <p>At Mexico City&#x2019;s Santa Martha Acatitla Prison for women, I have listened to prisoners who have been deeply touched or have actively participated in the violence that Mexico is experiencing today. My conversations with assassins, drug dealers, women who claim to be innocent, and with famous criminals exposed cruel and tender lives. In that prison of rough, bare cement walls, I looked at drawings of shells, sand and blue fish drawn by a seventy-year-old woman who had sold fish tacos on a beach before she was forced by drug traffickers to carry drugs across the Mexican border into the United States. She told me that she liked to steal the prison&#x2019;s saltshakers and rub salt on her skin so she would not forget the sea. </p> <p>After listening to the women in hiding and the women in jail, as well as the women who have been victims of crime, the primary story for me became Mexico&#x2019;s missing women and children. </p> <p>For years I had heard or read: <i>she disappeared; she never came back; today she would be celebrating her sixteenth birthday; I am praying for a sign; she went missing; some men came for her; if I go to the police they laugh at me; she was just walking, just walking down the street; she never called back; she never called; I can see her walk through the door; that man knows where my daughter is; he took some other girls; I feel she&#x2019;s still alive; somebody sent someone for my daughter; someone sent somebody for my daughter. </i></p> <p>Although there are no exact statistics, the number of women trafficked in Mexico is very high. According to the U.S. State Department, 600,000 to 800,000 people are trafficked across international borders every year. (Note this estimate does not include those trafficked within national borders.) Most people who are stolen and sold are subjected to sex trafficking or other forms of modern slavery: forced labor, debt... </p> <p>A woman can be sold to different owners many times, and even dozens of times a day as a prostitute, while a plastic bag of drugs can be sold once. </p> <p><i> Prayers for the Stolen </i>is a novel about Ladydi Garcia Mart�nez. She is part of a community, like so many in rural Mexico, that has been decimated by drug traffickers, government agricultural policies and illegal immigration. Her home is a village near the once glamorous port of Acapulco. Her story, although inspired by truth, is fiction. </p><p><b>Jennifer Clement </b>is the author of multiple books, including <i>Widow Basquiat</i>.

The tone is dark and intense; its elegant style is cut on the raw side; and the characters come from places we've all been." <b>-</b><i><b>The New York Times</b></i><p>All Monty Brogan ever really wanted when he grew up was to be a fireman. Now he's about to start a seven-year stretch in the federal penitentiary for drug dealing. With just twenty-four hours of freedom to go, he prowls the city with his girlfriend and his two best friends from high school-a high-flying bond trader and an idealistic teacher. As the minutes count down, Monty seizes one last chance to stack the odds in his favor. <br><br>Hurtling from the money pits of Wall Street to Manhattan's downtown lounge and club scene, from the enclaves of the Russian mob to the old immigrant neighborhoods, <i><b>The 25th Hour</b></i> evokes the pulsing rhythms and diamond-hard edges of a city in the raw, illusory hours between midnight and dawn. A taut and mesmerizing tale of an urban purgatory suspended between the crime and the punishment, <i><b>The 25th Hour</b></i> is a major player in contemporary noir fiction from the author of the bestselling novel <i>City of Thieves</i> and the short story collection <i>When the Nines Roll Over</i>. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p></p><p><b>Penzler Pick, January 2001:</b> <i>The 25th Hour</i> is a wonderfully written first novel that convincingly portrays the New York City of Wall Street brokers and middle-class white drug dealers, the new affluent class in a city where money can buy you almost anything and is often the most important factor in young people's lives.<p> Monty Brogan is about to start his last day of freedom before turning himself into the authorities and serving a seven-year term for drug dealing. He's a charming young man who had always dreamed of being a fireman, following in the working-class footsteps of his father, who has had to put up his bar in Queens as bond so that his son can stay out of jail until his sentence begins. Monty, named for Montgomery Clift, does not know how he managed to get himself into this predicament. It was easy money and it carried so many perks, and you'll feel more than a little sympathy for this young man who has managed to kill his own dream for courtside seats at Madison Square Garden.</p><p> But before he goes to prison, Monty wants to have one last night out on the town with his two best friends. Frank Slattery is a bond trader, one of the best and most successful risk takers in a very risky business. The other is Jakob Elinsky, an English teacher who envies his friends' lifestyles but who has no intention of ever giving up his job for the easy money, despite the disillusionment of teaching high school students in a tough school.</p><p> The three young men enjoy the night into the early morning as they eat, drink, and visit the hottest spots in town. It's a sad night for Monty, but he has a plan that neither Frank nor Jacob know about--and it makes for a shocking ending to this brilliant and disturbing story. <i>--Otto Penzler</i></p>David Benioff was born and raised in New York City.

"...one of the most entertaining rock memoirs of recent years..." - Houston Press</b><br><br>No one explodes one of the longest-held misconceptions of music history better than Steve Lukather and his band Toto. The dominant sound of the late &#x2018;70s and &#x2018;80s was not punk, but a slick, polished amalgam of rock and R&amp;B first staked out on Boz Scaggs&#x2019;&nbsp;<i>Silk Degrees</i>. That album was shaped in large part by the founding members of Toto, who were emerging as the most in-demand elite session crew in LA, and further developed on the band&#x2019;s self-titled multi-platinum debut. A string of massive hits followed for Toto while Lukather and bandmates David Paich, Jeff Porcaro, and Steve Porcaro also served as creative linchpins on some of the most successful and influential records of the era, including Michael Jackson&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Thriller</i>.<br> <br> In&nbsp;this incisive memoir, Lukather tells the complete Toto story. He also lifts the lid on what went on behind the closed studio doors, shedding light on the unique creative processes of some of the most legendary names in music: from Quincy Jones, Michael Jackson, Paul McCartney, Stevie Nicks, and Elton John to Miles Davis, Joni Mitchell, Bruce Springsteen, Don Henley, Roger Waters, and Aretha Franklin. Lukather&#x2019;s extraordinary tale also encompasses the dark side of stardom and the American Dream. Frank, engaging, and often hilarious,&nbsp;<i>The Gospel According to Luke</i>&nbsp;is no ordinary rock memoir. It is the real thing.</p><p>Steve Lukather is the sole founding member of Toto who has been in the ensemble consistently over the course of the band&#x2019;s entire career.&nbsp;Currently, he continues to tour the globe as the band&#x2019;s guitarist, and as one of several singers in the group.&nbsp;Additionally, he is a long tenured member of Ringo Starr&#x2019;s All Starr Band.&nbsp;From the &#x2019;70s through today, he has performed on thousands of albums and is considered one of the most prolific session players of all time.&nbsp; It can be stated there is not a set of ears on Earth who has not heard a performance of Steve &#x201c;Luke&#x201d; Lukather.</p><h2>Hot Mahogany (A Stone Barrington Novel)</h2><p><b>Stone Barrington is hired to protect a former intelligence agent with amnesia&#x2014;and secrets worth killing for&#x2014;in this heart-stopping thriller in the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling series.<br></b><br>Barton Cabot&#x2019;s intelligence career is even more top secret than that of his brother, CIA boss Lance Cabot.

For a week?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s where you&#x2019;ve been?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No. I&#x2019;ve been in Vero Beach, Florida, for flight training.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;For a week?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;For three days.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You have a new airplane?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not exactly. I had the engine removed from my Piper Malibu Mirage and replaced with a turbine&#x2014;that&#x2019;s a jet engine, turning a propeller. So now it&#x2019;s called a JetProp, and it&#x2019;s like a new airplane, and because it&#x2019;s like a new airplane, my insurance company insisted I have flight training in it from a guy named John Mariani, in Vero Beach.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Whatever you say.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Dino, why don&#x2019;t you remember any of this? How much have you had to drink?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You think I&#x2019;m drinking too much?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You seem to be in a state.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What sort of state?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The word stupor leaps to mind.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Genevieve will be here in a few minutes,&#x201d; Dino said. Genevieve James was Dino&#x2019;s girlfriend, a nurse in the ER at a nearby hospital.<br>&#x201c;Good.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;When she gets here, don&#x2019;t leave me.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m in some sort of trouble.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What kind of trouble?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, but if you&#x2019;re here, she won&#x2019;t hurt me.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m not getting in the middle of this,&#x201d; Stone said.<br>&#x201c;Just sit there in your chair and don&#x2019;t say anything, and it&#x2019;ll be all right.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Okay. I&#x2019;ll just sit here.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Stone?&#x201d; Dino was looking over Stone&#x2019;s shoulder, toward the door.<br>&#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Have you seen Lance Cabot lately?&#x201d; Cabot was the newly appointed deputy director for operations of the CIA. Both Dino and Stone had done consulting work for him.<br>&#x201c;Not lately.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well, he looks like shit,&#x201d; Dino said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s aged years.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;How do you know this?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Because I&#x2019;m looking at him right now.&#x201d;<br>Stone turned and looked toward the door. Lance Cabot stood there, looking, as Dino had said, years older. He was also a bit disheveled, needed a haircut, and had at least a three-day growth of beard. His face was bruised.<br>&#x201c;Good God, you&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; Stone said.<br>Lance was, ordinarily, the most fastidious of men, always perfectly dressed and groomed. Stone watched as Frank, one of the two headwaiters, greeted him and led him to a table at the rear of the restaurant.<br>&#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t even look at us,&#x201d; Dino said. &#x201c;Something&#x2019;s wrong. . . . Uh-oh,&#x201d; Dino said.<br>&#x201c;What now?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Genevieve.&#x201d;<br>Stone turned to see the beautiful Genevieve enter the restaurant and head for their table. They both stood, while Dino held her chair, a sure sign of fear.<br>&#x201c;How are you, Genevieve?&#x201d; Stone said, giving her a kiss.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m very well, Stone,&#x201d; she said, ignoring Dino. &#x201c;How was your Malibu training?&#x201d;<br>Stone shot a glance at Dino, who was looking very uncomfortable. &#x201c;Hard work and great fun. The new airplane is faster, smoother, and quieter, only it&#x2019;s not a Malibu anymore; it&#x2019;s called a JetProp.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I remember,&#x201d; she said.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going nuts,&#x201d; Dino said.<br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Lance just came in again, and he looks perfectly fine.&#x201d;<br>Stone turned and looked, and there he was, younger, undisheveled, unbruised, and perfectly groomed. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re both going nuts,&#x201d; Stone said.<br>Lance came over to the table and greeted them all, shaking their hands. &#x201c;Good evening,&#x201d; he said.<br>&#x201c;Lance,&#x201d; Dino said, &#x201c;you should be working as a magician.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I beg your pardon?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Because, in addition to standing here, you&#x2019;re sitting back there.&#x201d; Dino pointed.<br>&#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s my older brother, Barton Cabot.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Ahhhhh,&#x201d; Dino and Stone said, simultaneously.<br>&#x201c;He came in ahead of me while I finished a phone call in the car. If you&#x2019;ll excuse me, I&#x2019;m going to join him, but Stone, I&#x2019;d like to speak with you alone, after we&#x2019;ve ordered dinner.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; Stone said. In his experience, when Lance spoke to him alone, trouble invariably followed.<br>Lance went to join his brother.<br>&#x201c;Eerie resemblance,&#x201d; Genevieve said.<br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Dino agreed. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s like Lance can know exactly how he&#x2019;ll look in a few years.&#x201d;<br>Genevieve spoke to Dino for the first time. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s how you&#x2019;re going to look when I&#x2019;m finished with you,&#x201d; she said.<br>Stone made a point of inspecting a row of photographs of Elaine&#x2019;s regulars on the opposite wall.<br>Elaine came over and sat down, exchanging kisses with Genevieve. Dino looked relieved to have her there. &#x201c;So?&#x201d; she said.<br>&#x201c;I just got in,&#x201d; Stone replied.<br>&#x201c;From where?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;From Vero Beach, Florida.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What for?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Dino will explain it to you,&#x201d; Stone said.<br>Lance came and tapped Stone on the shoulder. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go into the next room for a minute,&#x201d; he said.<br>Dino looked anxious. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be all right,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;Elaine is here.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;ll help Genevieve,&#x201d; Dino said.<br>Stone got up and followed Lance into the dining room next door, where people occasionally threw parties and which Elaine used for overflow when the main room was full. They sat down at a table.<br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know you had a brother,&#x201d; Stone said.<br>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t had a brother for many years. Until tonight.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Does he live in New York?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Lance said.<br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I have no idea where he lives. Neither does he. That&#x2019;s the difficult thing.&#x201d;<br>Stone settled in for a story.</p><p><b>2</b></p><p>Stone thought Lance looked as though he needed a drink.<br>&#x201c;Can I get you a drink, Lance?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Thank you, no. We&#x2019;ve got a flap on&#x2014;two agents missing in Afghanistan&#x2014;and I have a meeting with the director in two hours.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;In the middle of the night?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I have to make a recommendation,&#x201d; Lance said. &#x201c;We think we know where they are: Do we send in more people to get them and risk the lives of a hundred men, or do we call in an air strike and kill everybody.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Including the two agents?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the decision. There&#x2019;s a chopper waiting for me at the West Side helipad. That&#x2019;s why I can&#x2019;t deal with this right now.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Deal with what?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;My brother, Barton.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Start at the beginning, Lance.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;My brother is four years older than I. Barton has been a star all his life: In school, in sports, wherever he went, he was always the star. Our mother died in childbirth with me. When I was twelve, our father died, and Barton became a surrogate father. He joined the Marines during the war in Vietnam, right out of Harvard; got a commission, led a platoon. I was at Harvard then. By the time it was over he was a colonel, commanding a regiment. Nobody in the Marines had advanced so quickly since World War Two. He was sent to the War College and told he would be a general before long, perhaps a future chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sounds like a spectacular career.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It was, until he abruptly resigned his commission and disappeared.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Disappeared?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Nobody could find him. I tried and failed. When I was giving my commencement speech at my graduation I looked down and saw him in the audience, but when the thing was over, he had disappeared again. I didn&#x2019;t see him again until tonight.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;So he abandoned you when you were in college?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not entirely. My fees were paid, and a generous check arrived every month from a trust he had set up to receive my inheritance, since I was not yet of age. I wrote to him in care of the bank, but my letter was returned.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But you heard from him tonight?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not exactly. I had a call earlier this evening from a hospital in New York, saying that the police had found him, three days ago, unconscious, on the street. He had been beaten and, apparently, robbed, since he had no money or identification. His wristwatch had been taken, too. He was unconscious for around thirty hours, and when he woke, he didn&#x2019;t know who he was. The police tried to identify him, and today they finally got a match on his fingerprints and got hold of his service record, where I was listed as his next of kin. Somebody at the Pentagon recognized my name and called me.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Has Barton recovered his memory?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Somewhat. He knows his name, he remembers me, but not much else. No one has been able to find an address for him, since his wallet was stolen. That&#x2019;s why I need your help.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What do you want me to do?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;His doctor told me that this sort of amnesia is usually temporary; the memory comes back in bits and pieces. It&#x2019;s a good sign that he has begun to remember. The hospital had to discharge him, since he has recovered from the beating and he has a next of kin. They released him to me tonight. But I can&#x2019;t take him back to Langley with me, not in the middle of this crisis.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Do you want me to find him a hotel?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s a good idea just yet; he needs to regain his memory before he can be left alone.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I suppose I could put him up at my house for a couple of days,&#x201d; Stone said.<br>&#x201c;Thank you, Stone. I don&#x2019;t think he&#x2019;ll be any trouble; he&#x2019;s quite docile. I&#x2019;d also like you, perhaps with Dino&#x2019;s help, to find out where he lives and, when he recovers himself, take him to his home.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But you don&#x2019;t have any idea at all where he lives?&#x201d;<br>Lance shook his head. &#x201c;None.&#x201d; He looked at his watch. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a car waiting to take me to the helipad. Come and meet Barton.&#x201d; He got up and led Stone into the main dining room.<br>Barton Cabot was sitting at his table, talking in a companionable way with Elaine, who was sitting with him.<br>&#x201c;Stone,&#x201d; Lance said, &#x201c;this is my brother.&#x201d;<br>Barton rose and extended his hand. &#x201c;Barton Cabot,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Elaine and I were just catching up.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You know Elaine?&#x201d; Lance asked.<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s an old customer,&#x201d; Elaine said. &#x201c;Haven&#x2019;t seen him for at least twenty years.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I remember being here,&#x201d; Barton said, &#x201c;but not how I got here or why.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s good,&#x201d; Lance said. He sat down and turned to his brother. &#x201c;Barton, I have to return to my office right now, but Stone, here, who is a good friend, is going to put you up at his house for a few days. You&#x2019;ll be very comfortable there.&#x201d; He slipped a card and some money into his jacket pocket. &#x201c;My number is there, if you need to reach me. We&#x2019;ll catch up in a few days.&#x201d;<br>Barton nodded. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s very good of you, Stone, to put me up,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;After all, I&#x2019;m a perfect stranger, even to myself.&#x201d;<br>Stone shrugged. &#x201c;Any brother of Lance&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br>Lance stood up and motioned for Stone to follow him. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m very grateful for this, Stone,&#x201d; he said as they walked toward the door. He took a card from his pocket and scribbled a number on the back. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s my cell number,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll call you tomorrow to see how he is, but if there&#x2019;s any sort of emergency, you can reach me, night or day, at that number. He seems to be about your size; can you loan him some clothes?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sure, but first let him have some dinner, then I&#x2019;ll get him home and to bed.&#x201d; They shook hands, and Lance went outside, got into a black SUV at the curb and was driven away.<br>Stone turned and went back to Barton Cabot&#x2019;s table. As he passed his own table he heard Genevieve and Dino.<br>&#x201c;If you would just tell me what this is about,&#x201d; Dino was pleading.<br>&#x201c;You know what it&#x2019;s about,&#x201d; Genevieve replied.<br>Stone kept walking. He sat down with Elaine and Barton and ordered some pasta, and the three of them had a quiet chat for a while. Barton kept up nicely, offered an opinion once in a while, and was charming, even witty. But he said nothing that seemed to require any direct memory of his circumstances.<br>Stone gave Barton his card, and he tucked it into a jacket pocket. &#x201c;Thank you, Stone,&#x201d; he said.<br>Well, Stone thought, at least he can remember my name. He excused himself to go to the men&#x2019;s room, and when he returned, both Barton and Elaine were no longer at the table.

Whatever caused it&#x2015;car crash, work accident, sports injury, domestic violence, combat&#x2015;a severe blow to the head results in acute and, often, lasting symptoms.

Vani Rao and Sandeep Vaishnavi&#x2015;experts in helping people heal after head trauma&#x2015;explain how traumatic brain injury, whether mild, moderate, or severe, affects the brain. They advise readers on how emotional symptoms such as depression, anxiety, mania, and apathy can be treated; how behavioral symptoms such as psychosis, aggression, impulsivity, and sleep disturbances can be addressed; and how cognitive functions like attention, memory, executive functioning, and language can be improved. They also discuss headaches, seizures, vision problems, and other neurological symptoms of traumatic brain injury. </p><p>By stressing that symptoms are real and are directly related to the trauma, Rao and Vaishnavi hope to restore dignity to people with traumatic brain injury and encourage them to ask for help.

She had greeted me at the door, mug of steaming coffee in her hand, two creams, one sugar, just like she did every morning. She was a pretty sistah -- tall, graceful, beautiful skin, perfect smile -- but she always seemed so stressed out. I often wondered why she let her executive assistant job get to her so much. Granted, I was stressed out all the time as well, but I had more to lose. Unlike me, Shelly earned no more than $889.95 after taxes, every two weeks, no matter what her work performance. </p><p> I glanced up at her, standing rigidly like she was preparing for a military drill. "Shelly, can I ask you a personal question?" </p><p> A nervous expression shadowed her face, causing me to wonder if she was afraid of me. We were the exact same age but had never bonded. I was the vice president of corporate development, pulling down 250K a year plus bonuses. She had barely finished high school. </p><p> "Sure. Go ahead," she finally responded. </p><p> "Do you ever just go out and have a good time?" I redirected my eyes to the window. There was not a cloud in the powder blue sky. "I mean, just let it all go, hang out with friends, party hearty?" </p><p> She giggled. She was gleaming at the mere thought of it. "My friends and I all go to this club over in Brooklyn every Friday night for happy hour, and sometimes we go to a reggae club on Saturdays." </p><p> "Reggae, huh?" It was my turn to giggle. "I can't even imagine you dancing to reggae music." </p><p> Shelly sat down facing me in one of the leather wing chairs across from my desk. I couldn't remember the last time she had actually taken a seat, other than to take dictation. I was pleased. It felt comfortable, like two sistahs shooting the breeze. </p><p> "What about you, Maylia? I mean, Ms. Kincaid." </p><p> "Maylia is fine," I responded. "You don't have to be so formal all the time." </p><p> "Thank you." </p><p> I didn't know whether to be flattered or offended by her thank you. Did she think I was so high-falutin' she had to show appreciation for calling me by my first name? </p><p> "So, what about you, Maylia? Do you ever just hang out?" </p><p> I pondered her question. I wasn't sure that attending business dinners with clients or boring social engagements at the country club with my parents constituted hanging out. </p><p> "Shelly, to be honest, I really don't know," I answered. "I go a lot of places, the finest restaurants and theaters in New York, but I can't remember the last time I actually had fun." </p><p> I gazed deep into her eyes and recognized something I hated: pity. I was pitiful. I needed to face facts. All the money, power, and security that I had in my life meant nothing unless I was enjoying the ride. </p><p> My parents had groomed me to take my place in high society, pure and simple. My father made his millions in international trade while my mother spent her days shopping in Macy's, Saks, and various boutiques on Fifth Avenue. I went to school at Yale University, graduated with honors, and nabbed a job with McMillan and Associates before I could even move out of my dorm good. </p><p> There I was, in my corner office on Fifty-ninth Street overlooking Central Park South, wondering what the hell I was doing with my life. Shelly did not have much money, but she had freedom. She could leave the office at five o'clock and do whatever she wished. I had to play negotiator over soft-shell crabs or spend my nights going over stacks of reports. I truly envied her. </p><p> I jumped up from my desk, startling Shelly. She jumped up too and waited for my instructions, assuming her military position again. </p><p> "I'm going out," I announced. </p><p> "Out? What about your meeting?" </p><p> "Cancel it!" I walked toward my private bath, grabbing my purse off my desk on the way. "In fact, cancel all of my appointments. I'm taking the day off!" </p><p> "But, but, but Ms. Kincaid, I mean Maylia," she stuttered, "what am I supposed to tell everybody?" </p><p> "Tell them I'm sick or something." I swung around to face her. "Isn't that what people usually say when they play hooky from school or work?" </p><p> Shelly shrugged her shoulders. "I guess." </p><p> I was about to close the bathroom door in her face when a lightbulb went off in my head. "Shelly, after you cancel all of my engagements, take the day off as well." </p><p> "Are you serious?" She put her hands on her hips, striking a sistahgurl pose. I fell out laughing. She looked good like that. </p><p> I put my purse on the vanity counter and struck the same pose. "Yeah, gurl, I'm serious!" I exclaimed in my best ghettoized accent. </p><p> "Well, <i>aiight</i> then." She giggled, enjoying our little scene. </p><p> I walked back out of the bathroom and raised my left palm. "Give me five!" </p><p> She slapped me a high five and laughed so hard that she was practically crying. "I guess I'll see you tomorrow, then?" </p><p> "Maybe. Maybe not," I chided, knowing good and well taking two days off in a row would be pushing it. They'd probably send the police to my penthouse to make sure I was still breathing. </p><p> Shelly strutted out of my office with more pep in her step than I had ever seen and closed the door. I went back in the bathroom and gazed in the mirror. Now, I was glowing. I felt so, so, so invigorated. The mere thought of actually shucking my responsibilities for an entire day was thrilling. </p><p> I took a good look at myself and decided I appeared to be more like fifty than my actual thirty years. My hair and makeup, not to mention the stuffy, conservative suit, put age on me. I pulled the clip out of my ebony hair and let it fall down across my shoulders. It had been so long since I physically and symbolically let my hair down. </p><p> I took off the blazer of my Donna Karan suit, unbuttoned my sleeves, and rolled them up to just below my elbows. I looked younger already. I turned to the side so I could see the profile of my body. My breasts were as pert as ever, and my ass was just as firm and round as it was in college. Too bad I didn't show off my assets more often. </p><p> I had no idea where I was going to go or what I was going to do today, but I was determined to savor and enjoy it. Then I thought about the park. Every day, I looked down from the twenty-fourth floor at the ant-size people Rollerblading, strolling, or riding bikes through Central Park. I didn't know the first thing about Rollerblading, and I hadn't been on a bike since my first year in high school, but I did know how to stroll. </p><p> The three-inch leather pumps I had on were not made for walking, though, so I dug through my closet behind the bathroom door and retrieved my gym bag. The same workout clothes had been in it for more than three years. I had every intention of hitting the corporate gym on the seventh floor -- I really did -- but time constraints just never allowed it. </p><p> I opted out of changing clothes completely, but I did take off my thigh-high stockings so I could put on my white crew socks and cross trainers. I had often laughed at the women walking down the street or catching the train in work clothes and tennis shoes. It looked so silly. But I was content to look silly for just one day. </p><p> When I emerged from my office less than five minutes later, Shelly was nowhere in sight. Her phone console had been forwarded to the night message, and all the papers I had seen strewn across her desk when I came in were neatly stacked in her in box. Girlfriend meant business about her day off. Now it was my turn to escape the madness. </p><p><br> I managed to get down to ground level in the elevator before someone began to question me. The security guard, Fred, wanted to know if I needed him to call a company car. I told him no thanks, that I would be taking a morning walk in the park. He looked at me in stunned disbelief. I left him sitting there at the security desk with his mouth wide open and swiveled through the revolving door into the brisk morning air. </p><p> I sucked air into my lungs, and it felt wonderful. I went to the corner and waited for the light to change before crossing the street and entering Central Park. People were laughing and enjoying themselves. They had lives, unlike me. </p><p> I walked down a path for a long time. The muscles in the back of my calves began aching, and I realized I needed to start working out. Not because of weight issues -- I was only carrying about 133 pounds on my five-six frame -- I was just out of shape, <i>period.</i> </p><p> I spotted an ice cream vendor and grew excited. I had not had an ice cream cone in years; just fancy desserts like biscotti, compote, and slices of cheesecake that cost more than having a pizza delivered. I half-ran over to the vendor and whipped out a five, asking for a double scoop of chocolate on a waffle cone. I licked my lips while he hand-packed the ice cream onto the cone. I paid him and then turned around just as a big-ass basketball appeared from nowhere and knocked the cone into me. Luckily, the ice cream was so hard that I only ended up with a brown circle over my left breast, but I was still pissed. My ice cream was on the ground. <i>What idiot would be so careless?</i> </p><p> I glanced up and saw the idiot coming toward me. I wanted to spew out a bunch of ugly words at him, but I could not. I was reared up better than that, and people do make mistakes. He was average-looking and I envisioned what type of woman would date him. Certainly not me. </p><p> He frowned. "I'm sorry. Did you get hurt?" </p><p> "No, I'm fine." I smiled at him and pointed to my shirt. "Just a little stain." </p><p> "Well, let me buy you another cone. That's the least I could do." He picked up the cone from the ground and tossed it into the nearest receptacle. "You should let me pay to have your shirt cleaned also." </p><p> "None of that is necessary. Really." </p><p> He wasn't paying attention. He was already digging into the pockets of his athletic shorts, searching for money. He paid the vendor for another cone. </p><p> "Thank you," I said as he handed it to me. </p><p> "You're welcome." He glanced back over to the basketball court, where three other men were standing, looking mighty impatient. "I better get back to the game. Have a nice day." </p><p> "You, too." </p><p> I decided that my best strategy was to find a bench and eat my cone. I did not want to risk someone bumping into me while I was walking and causing another mess. There was a bench on a hill about thirty feet from the basketball court, so I grabbed it seconds before a man in a suit with a bag lunch got to it. </p><p> I was sitting there, licking the hell out of my ice cream cone, when I started surveying the rest of the men on the court. One of them stood out from the rest. Not just because of his height, though he had to be at least six-five -- he stood out because he was the finest man I had seen in ages. Sepia skin, ebony eyes, and some seriously lickable lips. None of them had on a shirt, but his muscles put the rest of theirs to shame. </p><p> "Damn!" I heard myself exclaim out of lust. </p><p> Before I finished my cone, I was in heat. The ice cream did nothing to cool me down. I was sitting there fantasizing about that man's hands, tongue, and whatever else all over me. Once I finished my cone, I did not budge. I was mesmerized. How foolish, I finally said to myself. This is so unlike you, Maylia. </p><p> That may have been true. In fact, it was completely unlike me, but that did not keep me from following the brother when he threw his shirt back on and started walking away. </p><p> I had no idea what I hoped to accomplish by following him, but I kept my distance. I was sure he had absolutely no idea that I was trailing him until... </p><p> "Why don't you just walk beside me?" </p><p> Was he talking to me? Unfortunately, he was. He had stopped dead in his tracks and turned around, staring down at me. </p><p> "Excuse me?" was the only response I could come up with. </p><p> "I said, why don't you just walk beside me?" </p><p> "Why would I want to do that?" I asked, feigning innocence. </p><p> "It's better than following me." He grinned. "You are following me, right?" </p><p> "Don't be absurd!" I could not believe his nerve. Even if he was right about me following him, he did not need to point it out. "What are you, some sort of narcissist or something?" </p><p> "I have no idea what that means." </p><p> "A person who's egotistical, full of themselves." </p><p> "Now, I do know what that means, but I'm not that." He pushed a loose hair away from my face and I felt faint. He was turning me on so much that it was scary. "I am flattered, though." </p><p> "I can't imagine why," I replied, determined to keep some composure. </p><p> "I saw the way you were checking a brotha out on the court." </p><p> "Oh, were you just playing basketball back there?" I asked the question with a straight face. "I wasn't paying attention. I was too busy eating my ice cream cone." </p><p> "The way you ate it was a treat in itself." He licked his lips. I wanted to lick them for him. "It made me wonder if you devour everything else like that." </p><p> "You're nasty." </p><p> He came a step closer, and I could smell his sweat. Even that was turning me on. "And you're fine." </p><p> "I'm also well-bred. I don't tolerate men speaking to me in such a fashion." That much was true. I was not used to men addressing me like that. The majority of the men I had dealt with felt like they had to impress my parents first, so they always went out of their way to be completely proper. That was why my sex life had been so drab. "I only hold conversations with gentlemen." </p><p> I could tell by the way his eyes narrowed that he was offended. "Then why don't you converse your ass back in the opposite direction?" </p><p> "This is a free country." I stepped around him and started walking. "I can go wherever I please and do whatever I want." </p><p> He grabbed my arm and swung me around. "What do you want to do right now?" </p><p> "For starters, I'd like for you to let go of my arm." I tried to free my arm, but he overpowered me. </p><p> He started walking, pulling me along with him. "Come on, let's go." </p><p> "Let's go where?" I asked out of curiosity. I was being accosted in Central Park, and instead of screaming for help, I was asking questions. Bad sign. </p><p> "My place, of course. It's not that far. Unless you'd prefer me to sex you down right here in the park." </p><p> His place? "You're a lunatic!" I lashed out at him. </p><p> "And you're fine." </p><p> I could not help but blush. After all, that was the second time he had called me fine. </p><p> He stopped walking, let my arm go, and eyed me seductively. "I bet you wear nothing but the finest, sexiest lingerie. Probably silk or satin thongs and lacy, revealing bras." He crossed his arms and cu...</p></p><h2>Time Is a River</h2><p>With a strong, warm voice that brings the South to life, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Mary Alice Monroe writes richly textured stories that intimately portray the complex and emotional relationships we share with families, friends, and the natural world. "Every book that Mary Alice Monroe has written has felt like a homecoming to me," writes Pat Conroy, bestselling author of <i>The Prince of Tides</i>. <br> <br> <i>Time Is a River</i> is an insightful novel that will sweep readers away to the seductive southern landscape, joining books by authors such as Anne Rivers Siddons and Sue Monk Kidd. <br> <br> Recovering from breast cancer and reeling from her husband's infidelity, Mia Landan flees her Charleston home to heal in the mountains near Asheville, North Carolina. She seeks refuge in a neglected fishing cabin belonging to her fly-fishing instructor, Belle Carson. <br> <br> Belle recently inherited the cabin, which once belonged to a grandmother she never knew -- the legendary fly fisher and journalist of the 1920s, Kate Watkins, whose life fell into ruins after she was accused of murdering her lover. Her fortune lost in the stock market crash and her reputation destroyed, Kate slipped into seclusion in the remote cabin. After her death the fishing cabin remained locked and abandoned for decades. Little does Belle know that by opening the cabin doors to Mia for a summer's sanctuary, she will open again the scandal that plagued Belle's family for generations. <br> <br> From her first step inside the dusty cabin, Mia is fascinated by the traces of Kate's mysterious story left behind in the eccentric furnishings of the cabin. And though Belle, ashamed of the tabloid scandal that tortured her mother, warns Mia not to stir the mud, Mia is compelled to find out more about Kate...especially when she discovers Kate's journal. <br> <br> The inspiring words of the remarkable woman echo across the years. Mia has been learning to fly-fish, and Kate's wise words comparing life to a river resonate deeply. She begins a quest to uncover the truth behind the lies. As she searches newspaper archives and listens to the colorful memories of the local small-town residents, the story of a proud, fiercely independent woman emerges. Mia feels a strange kinship with the woman who, like her, suffered fears, betrayal, the death of loved ones, and a fall from grace -- yet found strength, compassion and, ultimately, forgiveness in her isolation. A story timeless in its appeal emerges, with a power that reopens old wounds, but also brings a transforming healing for Mia, for Kate's descendants, and for all those in Mia's new community.</p><p>Mary Alice Monroe is the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling author of more than twenty books, including the Beach House series:&nbsp;<i>The Beach House, Beach House Memories, Swimming Lessons, Beach House for Rent</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Beach House Reunion</i>.

Fed by rain and melted snow, rivulets of cold, clear water gush over boulders and between rocky ridges to lace the mountainsides. Thousands of miles of freestone streams run unchecked, cascading down to form the mighty rivers. </p><p> Mia Landan followed the river as it wound in a serpentine manner, deeper into the woods. To her right, the sienna-hued wall of rock was dotted with patches of bright green moss. To her left, the river raced on, rushing forward in a confident current. She reached over the passenger seat of her car to clutch a wrinkled sheet of paper from under a torn road map. Scribbled across the page of directions she read, <i>Follow the river</i>. </p><p> "I am not lost," she said aloud, though she doubted her words. She was following the pebbles in the river like Hansel and Gretel, believing that they would lead her through the dark forest to a safe haven. Except Mia Landan no longer believed in fairy tales. </p><p> Thunder rolled overhead, threatening rain. Back home in Charleston, South Carolina, the spring rain had already given way to scorching heat and humidity. Here in the North Carolina mountains, however, the air was still cool and the forests aflame with wildflowers. Around each bend in the road she encountered a cluster of rhododendrons blooming scarlet or white. A little farther on, the paved road ended to become a rutted bed of dirt and gravel, as worn and filled with holes as a pauper's coat. </p><p> A few fat drops of rain splattered against the windshield, turning the dust to long streaks of mud. She turned on the windshield wipers and her heartbeat matched the metronome click. She leaned far over the wheel, clutching it tight, peering through the sudden deluge at the sliver of road ahead. Where was the cabin? she worried as she peered through the rain and fog. Could it be this far off the beaten track? Just when she thought she should turn around and head back, the river tumbled over a ridge of rocks to a large pool. Beside it on a high bank, nestled between a pair of towering hemlocks, sat a rustic log cabin. </p><p> Mia released a ragged sigh, slumped her shoulders, and loosened her grip on the wheel. She had found it. It had been a long, circuitous drive with directions scribbled in haste. But she'd made it. Her wheels hit soft grass and mud as she parked as close to the cabin as she could. </p><p> Turning off the engine, she was immediately immersed in a deep mountain silence. The miles still raced in her veins. Her clothes clung and the car seat was littered with empty water bottles and candy wrappers. The stale air reminded her of hospital rooms. She lowered the window enough to let the fresh air awaken her after the long journey. The rain sprinkled in and she lifted her face to it, tasting its cool sweetness. </p><p> Mia looked again to the cabin. It lurked, isolated and foreboding, under the canopy of the trees and mist. The woods seemed to close in around her. She felt a shiver of loneliness. But hadn't she wanted a faraway, secluded place? A sanctuary? Rolling up the window she cast a worried glance at the clock on the dashboard. It was half past six. Belle had told her she would pick up supplies and meet her at the cabin no later than seven. There was nowhere to go. The cabin was locked and the rain was coming down in sheets. She was trapped in this car, in the wilderness, to wait as the night closed in around her. Relentless rain coursed tracks down her foggy window, mirroring the tears flowing down her cheeks. Mia brought her hands to her face and wondered how she got to this place. </p><p> It had all begun with fly-fishing. She'd never had any interest in the sport. She was a public relations director for the Spoleto arts festival in Charleston. Though she lived by the ocean and mountains, she didn't have any connection to either. Her idea of a good time was drinks and dinner at a restaurant with friends. If she went on a boat, it was docked for a party. A trip to the mountains meant a few days at a ski lodge. Nonetheless, her sister, Madeline, had signed her up for a three-day fly-fishing retreat designed especially for breast cancer survivors. Casting for Recovery provided spiritual and physical therapy, and Madeline believed Mia needed both. </p><p> So that spring Mia had driven hours from her home in Charleston to the Casting for Recovery retreat in the foothills of North Carolina. She'd agreed to go only to keep Madeline from nagging. Some of the women at the retreat were still early in their treatments. Others were ten, twenty, or more years post-diagnosis. At thirtyeight years old, Mia was the youngest. She was reticent at first, but Belle would not allow her to remain aloof. </p><p> Belle Carson was their fly-fishing guide and the leader of the retreat. Belle was a tall, straight-talking, sensitive, and big-hearted woman who had chucked an academic career at the University of Virginia to move to Asheville, North Carolina, and open her own fly-fishing business. Belle gently coaxed Mia out of isolation into group discussions and taught her how to cast a dry fly. Mia was drawn into the group by force of the women's brutal honesty and their wise understanding. It was an intense three days that felt like three weeks, so much had transpired. They laughed, they cried. They were sister survivors. By the end of the retreat she'd joined their feminine solidarity formed by a shared history. </p><p> But it was in the river that Mia felt the first glimmer of life since the shock of her diagnosis had left her heart as numb as the white scar on her chest. Belle Carson had taught her how to cast a thin line from a rod onto the shallow waters of the Davidson River. To her amazement, she found hope rising in thin wisps of speckled silver. She might not have believed in fairy tales, but she believed in that spark of life she felt at the other end of the line. </p><p> Eager to share her new excitement with her husband, she'd hugged the women farewell and drove back a day early to Charleston. Closing her eyes, Mia saw again the lurid image of her husband and that unknown woman lying on her marriage bed. She'd stumbled down the stairs, climbed back into her car, and started to drive, her eyes blind and her mind numb. </p><p> Mia Landan of two years ago would have stood her ground and confronted them. Then, she was confident in her career, her beauty, her self. <i>That</i> Mia would not have run to the mountains with her tail between her legs. But two years ago Mia had not yet found the lump in her breast. </p><p> The wheels had hummed beneath her on the highway. The green road signs passed in a blur as she put miles between herself and her husband's infidelity. She'd driven for forty-five minutes before she realized she didn't know where she was. When at last she focused on the signs she saw she was on Interstate 26. Her instincts were acting as her compass, guiding her north, back to the mountains where she'd felt safe. </p><p> By the time she'd returned to the retreat, the sun had lowered far to the west and the placid water of the lake had darkened to a deep purple. A few dimples disturbed the glassiness. <i>Rises</i>, she'd learned they were called, were created by trout when they rose to the surface to sip an insect. She drove past the wall of tall firs and hemlocks that surrounded the lake to the row of cottages that she'd shared with the eighteen other women at the retreat. Now they all stood empty and quiet. One by one, each woman had returned to a husband, a family, a partner. For them, life had gone on post-cancer. At that moment, Mia saw with clarity that she was not a survivor. </p><p> She couldn't go back to Charleston. She could not start the engine and drive. She had nothing and no one waiting for her. She'd brought her trembling hands to her face and began to sob. </p><p> Perhaps if she hadn't felt such hope on the river, she could have maintained the hard shell of apathy that had sustained her for the year of treatment and recovery. But the spirit of the river, the rhythm of the cast, and the tenuous connection to life at the end of a thin line had broken through her shell. It had filled her with silvery light, lifted her up and made her feel whole again. To lose that now... </p><p> Belle Carson had been walking down the road and saw Mia crying the hoarse, ragged sobs of a desperate woman. She opened the car door. </p><p> "Mia? What are you doing here? Are you all right?" </p><p> Mia swung around, lifting her face. "I can't go back," she cried in a broken voice. </p><p> Belle leaned over, her long braid slipping over her shoulder, and asked more urgently, "What happened?" </p><p> "He's left me. I have nowhere to go." </p><p> Belle took Mia's arm, then gently but firmly drew her from the car. "Come with me," she said, putting her arm around Mia's shoulders. She guided her inside the lodge which, mercifully, was deserted. Belle treated Mia like she would an injured animal, gently and with a calm voice, giving her time to settle until the panic faded from her eyes. She offered Mia coffee, then rummaged through the camp fridge to prepare a plate and set it before her. When Mia sat slump-shouldered and looked at the food with a dazed expression, Belle didn't nag at her to eat it. She'd sat across from Mia and waited while the sun lowered and the geese honked by the lake, calling their young. When the grief trickled out, Belle handed her tissues, and later, when it gushed, she listened patiently before asking questions. </p><p> It was Belle's dark brown eyes that Mia remembered more than anything she'd actually said. They were calm waters, like the lake, and in their depths she'd felt hope rising. </p><p> Then Belle offered Mia what she needed most -- safe refuge. </p><p> "I have a place," Belle told her. "A cabin not too far away. It's not much. It's been abandoned for years and I haven't checked on it in months. But it's yours, if you want to s...</p></p><h2>Death in the Air</h2><p><strong>A real-life thriller in the vein of <em>The Devil in the White City</em>, Kate Winkler Dawson's debut <i>Death in the Air </i>is a gripping, historical narrative of a serial killer, an environmental disaster, and an iconic city struggling to regain its footing. </strong><br><br> London was still recovering from the devastation of World War II when another disaster hit: for five long days in December 1952, a killer smog held the city firmly in its grip and refused to let go. Day became night, mass transit ground to a halt, criminals roamed the streets, and some 12,000 people died from the poisonous air. But in the chaotic aftermath, another killer was stalking the streets, using the fog as a cloak for his crimes.<br><br> All across London, women were going missing--poor women, forgotten women. Their disappearances caused little alarm, but each of them had one thing in common: they had the misfortune of meeting a quiet, unassuming man, John Reginald Christie, who invited them back to his decrepit Notting Hill flat during that dark winter. They never left.<br><br> The eventual arrest of the "Beast of Rillington Place" caused a media frenzy: were there more bodies buried in the walls, under the floorboards, in the back garden of this house of horrors? Was it the fog that had caused Christie to suddenly snap? And what role had he played in the notorious double murder that had happened in that same apartment building not three years before--a murder for which another, possibly innocent, man was sent to the gallows?<br><br> The Great Smog of 1952 remains the deadliest air pollution disaster in world history, and John Reginald Christie is still one of the most unfathomable serial killers of modern times. Journalist Kate Winkler Dawson braids these strands together into a taut, compulsively readable true crime thriller about a man who changed the fate of the death penalty in the UK, and an environmental catastrophe with implications that still echo today.</p><p><b>Kate Winkler Dawson</b> is a seasoned documentary producer, whose work has appeared in <i>The New York Times,</i> WCBS News and ABC News Radio, Fox News Channel, United Press International, <i>PBS NewsHour, </i>and <i>Nightline</i>. She teaches journalism at The University of Texas at Austin.<br>"<i>Death in the Air</i> by Kate Winkler Dawson is a fascinating, beautifully researched, and compulsively readable book, which tells the entwined stories of the Great London Smog of 1952 and a serial killer, John Reginald Christie, who exploited the fog as a cloak for murder. This is a portrait of London at one of its darkest and most desperate times.

This is a true tale of criminal violence against the backdrop of one of the worst environmental disasters of all time, one that led to the death of 12,000 people.

But <i>Death in the Air</i> is hardly another study of a depraved serial killer. It's also a riveting history of London in the years after World War II--a city beset by political cover ups and misguided police investigations.

Naomi Klein's second book, <i>The Shock Doctrine</i>, was hailed as a "master narrative of our time," and has over a million copies in print worldwide.</p><p>In the last decade, <i>No Logo </i>has become an international phenomenon and a cultural manifesto for the critics of unfettered capitalism worldwide. As America faces a second economic depression, Klein's analysis of our corporate and branded world is as timely and powerful as ever.</p><p>Equal parts cultural analysis, political manifesto, mall-rat memoir, and journalistic expos�, <i>No Logo</i> is the first book to put the new resistance into pop-historical and clear economic perspective. Naomi Klein tells a story of rebellion and self-determination in the face of our new branded world.</p></p><p>We live in an era where image is nearly everything, where the proliferation of brand-name culture has created, to take one hyperbolic example from Naomi Klein's <i>No Logo</i>, "walking, talking, life-sized Tommy [Hilfiger] dolls, mummified in fully branded Tommy worlds." Brand identities are even flourishing online, she notes--and for some retailers, perhaps best of all online: "Liberated from the real-world burdens of stores and product manufacturing, these brands are free to soar, less as the disseminators of goods or services than as collective hallucinations." <p> In <i>No Logo</i>, Klein patiently demonstrates, step by step, how brands have become ubiquitous, not just in media and on the street but increasingly in the schools as well. (The controversy over advertiser-sponsored Channel One may be old hat, but many readers will be surprised to learn about ads in school lavatories and exclusive concessions in school cafeterias.) The global companies claim to support diversity, but their version of "corporate multiculturalism" is merely intended to create more buying options for consumers. When Klein talks about how easy it is for retailers like Wal-Mart and Blockbuster to "censor" the contents of videotapes and albums, she also considers the role corporate conglomeration plays in the process. How much would one expect Paramount Pictures, for example, to protest against Blockbuster's policies, given that they're both divisions of Viacom?</p><p> Klein also looks at the workers who keep these companies running, most of whom never share in any of the great rewards. The president of Borders, when asked whether the bookstore chain could pay its clerks a "living wage," wrote that "while the concept is romantically appealing, it ignores the practicalities and realities of our business environment." Those clerks should probably just be grateful they're not stuck in an Asian sweatshop, making pennies an hour to produce Nike sneakers or other must-have fashion items. Klein also discusses at some length the tactic of hiring "permatemps" who can do most of the work and receive few, if any, benefits like health care, paid vacations, or stock options. While many workers are glad to be part of the "Free Agent Nation," observers note that, particularly in the high-tech industry, such policies make it increasingly difficult to organize workers and advocate for change.</p><p> But resistance is growing, and the backlash against the brands has set in. Street-level education programs have taught kids in the inner cities, for example, not only about Nike's abusive labor practices but about the astronomical markup in their prices. Boycotts have commenced: as one urban teen put it, "Nike, we made you. We can break you." But there's more to the revolution, as Klein optimistically recounts: "Ethical shareholders, culture jammers, street reclaimers, McUnion organizers, human-rights hacktivists, school-logo fighters and Internet corporate watchdogs are at the early stages of demanding a citizen-centered alternative to the international rule of the brands ... as global, and as capable of coordinated action, as the multinational corporations it seeks to subvert." <i>No Logo</i> is a comprehensive account of what the global economy has wrought and the actions taking place to thwart it. <i>--Ron Hogan</i></p>There's a bad mood rising against the corporate brands. No Logo is the warning on the label. <p>Once a poster boy for the new economy, Bill Gates has become global whipping boy. Nike's swoosh - the marketing success of the nineties - is now equated with sweatshop labour, and teenage MacDonald's workers are joining the Teamsters. What is going on? No Logo, an incisive and insightful report from the frontlines of mounting backlash against multinational corporations, explains why some of the most revered brands in the world are finding themselves on the wrong end of a bottle of spray paint, a computer hack, or an international anti-corporate campaign.</p> <p>No Logo uncovers a betrayal of the central promises of the information age: choice, interactivity, and increased freedom. And as job security disappears, the respectful reverence which corporations enjoyed as engines of the economy is also dissipating - as is their protection from worker and citizen rage.</p> <p>Equal parts cultural analysis, political manifesto, mall-rat memoir, and journalistic expos�, No Logo is the first book to put the new resistance into pop-historical and clear economic perspective. Naomi Klein tells a story of rebellion and self-determination in the face of our new branded world.</p></p><h2>Labor with Hope: Gospel Meditations on Pregnancy, Childbirth, and Motherhood</h2><p><p>"Beautiful meditations for you to ponder as you labor through your pregnancy and wonder, 'Why is this like it is?'"<br><strong>Elyse Fitzpatrick, </strong> author, <em>Give Them Grace</em></p> <p><strong>The world is filled with mixed messages about pregnancy.</strong> Popular books and well-meaning family and friends offer you unsolicited advice about what to expect and how to stay healthy--sometimes resulting in joy and excitement but other times leading to discouragement and fear.</p> <p>The Bible, too, has a lot to say about childbirth--offering real hope that nothing in this world can match.

The daily, convulsive questions of life and death that the committee struggles with are often questions without answers, yet they are somehow answered at the Hermann Hospital and in hospitals across the country every single day.

Calder was always fiddling with odds and ends, making objects for friends. When he got older and became an artist, his fiddling led him to create wire sculptures. One day, Sandy made a lion. Next came a lion cage. Before he knew it, he had an entire circus and was traveling between Paris and New York performing a brand-new kind of art for amazed audiences.<p> This is the story of Sandy?s Circus, as told by Tanya Lee Stone with Boris Kulikov?s spectacular and innovative illustrations. Calder?s original circus is on permanent display at the Whitney Museum in New York City.<br><br></p></p><p>Tanya Lee Stone has written many biographies for young readers. She lives in Burlington, Vermont.Starred Review. Grade 2&#x2013;4&#x2014;What child&#x2014;or adult&#x2014;is not intrigued by a mobile: moving, swaying, changing in light and space as it intrigues and delights. Calder's name is nearly synonymous with these creations, and Stone and Kulikov spin out a fast-moving tale that is in keeping with their high-energy subject. From childhood, Sandy produced an array of objects for friends and family from found materials. As an adult, when hired to draw pictures of the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, he took the project one step further, bringing the circus to life with bits of wire, cork, buttons, yarns, and string. Eventually, his creations filled five suitcases, and the performances included chariot races; bucking broncos; and high-wire acts that flipped, leaped, and danced in the air. Audiences loved it. Stone depicts Calder as a man utterly involved in his work, and Kulikov strengthens the premise using two differing styles of illustration&#x2014;often on the same page. He portrays Calder in a Gulliver-like mode: stepping between New York and Paris in giant strides, forming his wire characters with hands that dominate an entire spread, and sprawling happily across the floor as part of the circus performance. These depictions, in full robust colors, often show Calder in childlike poses, interacting with the wire animals, oblivious to an artist muse who floats above him.

So Ying-Ying, their grandmother, tells them a tale from long ago. On the night of the Moon Festival, when Ying-ying was a little girl, she encountered the Moon Lady, who grants the secret wishes of those who ask, and learned from her that the best wishes are those you can make come true yourself. This haunting tale, adapted from Amy Tan's best-seller <i>The Joy Luck Club</i> and enhanced by Gretchen Schields's rich, meticulously detailed art, is a book for all to treasure.</p><p>Grade 4-6-- This is a reworking of a story from the author's adult novel, The Joy Luck Club (Putnam, 1989). Here it is set in the frame of a grandmother regaling her three granddaughters on a rainy afternoon with a tale from her childhood. On the evening of the Moon Festival, she is separated from her family, and goes through several fascinating and scary adventures until she is finally reunited with them. Tan has a good tale here, and she retells it well for children: while the story is in progress, it is told from the child's point of view; at beginning and ending frames, the grandmother's voice is used. The illustrations are an integral part of this version and can best be described as phantasmagorical or Chinese baroque. They are extremely detailed, providing both accurate cultural detail of the period (the tale is set somewhere in the two decades after the fall of the Qing Dynasty, i.e., the 1920s or '30s) and a child's romantic imaginings. Primary colors reign in the 12 sumptuous full-page pictures, as well as in the smaller vignettes that pepper and punctuate the narrative. A successful collaboration of compelling text and absorbing illustrations that will make young readers crave more. --John Philbrook, San Francisco Public Library<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.A girl's adventures on the night of the Moon Festival make for "a haunting tale... worthy of retelling and of repeated rereading," said PW in a starred review.

Langstroth, "the father of modern beekeeping," revolutionized the practice of beekeeping. Originally published in 1853, his work constitutes the first descriptive treatise of modern bee management &#x2014; its innovations allowed people to engage in actual beekeeping, rather than simply handling bee domiciles and extracting the honey. This book explains and illustrates techniques still employed 150 years later &#x2014; including the author's patented invention, a movable frame hive that quickly spread into common use around the world.<br>In his reader-friendly, nontechnical style, Langstroth addresses every aspect of beekeeping: bee physiology; diseases and enemies of bees; the life-cycles of the queen, drone, and worker; bee-hives; and the handling of bees. An infectious sense of wonder and enthusiasm suffuses Langstroth's accounts of natural and artificial swarming, the production of honey and wax, and the best methods of feeding bees and maintaining an apiary. The manual abounds in practical and intriguing insights attained through the years of observation and experience, including "the kindness of bees to one another," "their infatuation for liquid sweets," and "the warning given by bees before stinging."<br>This version of Langstroth's ever-popular manual is the fourth and final edition; it incorporates the author's own revisions and remains an unsurpassed resource for beekeepers.</p><p></p><h2>I Never Met a Story I Didn&#39;t Like: Mostly True Tall Tales</h2><p>For years, Todd Snider has been one of the most beloved country-folk singers in the United States, compared to Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, John Prine, and dozens of others. He's become not only a new-century Dylan but a modern-day Will Rogers, an everyman whose intelligence, self-deprecation, experience, and sense of humor make him a uniquely American character. In live performance, Snider's monologues are cheered as much as his songs. But never before has he told the whole story. Running the gamut from personal memoir to shaggy-dog comedy to rueful memories of his troubles and triumphs with drugs and alcohol to sharp-eyed observations from years on the road, <i>I Never Met a Story I Didn't Like</i> is for fans of Snider's music, but also for fans of America itself: the broad, wild country that has produced figures of folk wisdom like Will Rogers, Mark Twain, Ambrose Bierce, Tonya Harding, Garrison Keillor, and more. There are storytellers and there are performers and there are stand-up comedians. And then there's Todd Snider, who is all three in one, and something else entirely.</p><p><b>Todd Snider</b> is one of the premier folk-rock-country artists in the entire world. He has sold millions of records, topped critics' favorite lists for the last decade, and performed or collaborated with John Prine, Billy Bragg, Jimmy Buffett, Robert Earl Keen, Widespread Panic, Yonder Mountain String Band, Jerry Jeff Walker, and Loretta Lynn. He continues to tour nationwide, doing approximately 150 shows per year, and when not touring he makes his home in East Nashville, Tennessee.<br>[Gives] devout fans more insight into the man and his music...[a] memoir that's a lot like being at a very long Snider show, without the melodies."<b> <i>Kirkus</i></b><br><br><b>Playboy, Book of the Month&#x201d;, May 2014</b><br>"[A] riotous memoir...Todd Snider calls himself a folk singer, but he's what your dad would refer to as a card...Basically this undeservedly unpopular singer has led a life like Keith Richard's without the fame and money to hold him down."<br><br><b>USAToday.com, 4/25/14</b><br> If I can't sit on this guy's porch for a few hours and chat over some brews, this is the next best thing.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Chapter 16, 4/30/14</b><br> A sort of freewheeling musician's K�nstlerroman Snider writes candidly, matter-of-factly He's affably aware of who he is and who he owes, and a gratitude for his life is evident on every page. Well-known in his field, comfortable in the company of the greats, but just shy of the point where fame sours into a daily burden, Snider knows he's hit the sweet spot...Todd Snider's fans will adore <i>I Never Met a Story I Didn't Like</i>, and the book is sure to add to their ranks. Newcomers, welcome to Snider's world. You may forget you had to be anywhere else. Snider has a story or three, and you're almost guaranteed to get broke out in belly laughs over one of them. Start a tab and sit the hell down.&#x201d;<br><br>"[Snider] combines the sly phrasing of a stoner, the perfect timing of a stand-up comedian, and a mastery of the tiny detail."<b> <i>The New Yorker</i></b><br><br>"Todd Snider's compressed story songs are so vivid and knowing that they seem completely plausible.... But the most compelling character may be Snider: a lowlife Randy Newman."<b> <i>Rolling Stone</i></b><br><br>"Okay, so he looks a bit like Beck, twangs and rambles like John Prine or Bob Dylan, crafts a song like Arlo Guthrie, and tells a deadpan joke in the vein of Zach Galifianakis, but Tennessee songwriter's songwriter Todd Snider is a rare performer who can at once channel tradition and still step poignantly and hilariously out of its shadow.... He's a king-hell musical storyteller, possibly the greatest of his generation.&#x201d;<b> <i>Paste Magazine</i></b><br><br> In <i>I Never Met a Story I Didn't Like</i>, Snider compiles mostly true tall tales' that will appeal to fans of his loopy, yet common sense-laden onstage banter. The book reads like a loose-limbed memoir with recollections of an inauspicious high school football career mixed with music business encounters with Jimmy Buffett, Garth Brooks, and others.

But mostly laughing. This book could be an exercise program for your face. This is no genteel memoir . I cannot recommend this book highly enough for those who enjoy unvarnished views of the music business from the inside, humor that's rowdy and wry, and a writer who treats the English language like origami made from a tab of acid.&#x201d;</p><h2>Let the Wind Rise (3) (Sky Fall)</h2><p><b>The breathtaking action and romance build to a climax in this thrilling conclusion to the Sky Fall trilogy from the <i>New York Times</i> and <i>USA TODAY</i> bestselling author of the Keeper of the Lost Cities series.</b><br><br>Vane Weston is ready for battle.

It is history as it ought to be written - from the bottom up and the top down, with monumental sensitivity to the compromise and conflict between the two extremes. Its two stories - those of Henry Ford and Ford-worker Abner Shutt, unfold side by side, indeed dialectically. They are, in the end, one story: the saga of class and culture in &#39;Ford-America&#39;. Workers and bosses, flappers and Klansmen, war and depression, Prohibition outlaws and high-society parties, unions and anti-union gun thugs - few aspects of American life in the first four decades of the last century are missing from this small masterpiece. The Flivver King sustains the same sure grasp of working class life which characterized Sinclair&#39;s earlier classic, The Jungle, but much less sentimentally and with a steadier focus on how alienated work breeds not only degradation but also resistance and revolt. Originally written in 1937 to aid the United Automobile Workers&#39; organizing drive, The Flivver King answers the question &#34;Why do we need a union?&#34; with quiet eloquence. The Charles H. Kerr Company has reissued it as a great American novel and an important historical document, because that question has never gone away and is now more vital than ever.

Although his own family was extremely poor, he spent periods of time living with his wealthy grandparents. He later argued that witnessing these extremes turned him into a socialist. Sinclair funded his college education by writing stories for newspapers and magazines. Sinclair s first novel was published in 1901. Sinclair was extremely active in socialist politics throughout his life. His novel &#34;Dragon s Teeth&#34; (1942) on the rise of Nazism won him the Pulitzer Prize. By the time Upton Sinclair died in 1968, he had published more than ninety books.</p><h2>Michael Moorcock&#39;s Elric Vol. 3: The White Wolf</h2><p><b>A stunning comic adaptation of the classic Elric of Melnibon� novels by Michael Moorcock!</b><br><br>A year has passed since Elric left Imrryr, his palace and his throne, leaving behind a heartbroken Cymoril.

Like the puppy dog at the pound, I looked through the glass, wishing someone would pick me to be theirs. I had a phone full of far-flung friends&#x2019; phone numbers, but I didn&#x2019;t yet know anyone I could just sit and laugh with in a caf�.<br> <br> It hit me how very hard the friendship process is. I&#x2019;m an outgoing, socially comfortable woman with a long line of good friendships behind me. And yet I stood there feeling very lonely. And insecure. And exhausted at just the idea of how far I was from that reality.<br> <br> I knew I couldn&#x2019;t just walk in there and introduce myself to them. &#x201c;Hi! You look like fun women, can I join you?&#x201d; I would have been met with stares of pity. No one wants to seem desperate, even if we are. We don&#x2019;t have platonic pick-up lines memorized. Flirting for friends seems creepy. Asking for her phone number like we&#x2019;re going to call her up for a Saturday night date is just plain weird. All the batting of my eyelashes wasn&#x2019;t going to send the right signals.<br> <br> And so I turned away from the scene of laughter and walked away.<br> <br> No, unfortunately, friendships don&#x2019;t just happen.<br> <br> <b>We Value Belonging</b><br> <br> Friendships may not happen automatically, but what we crave about them sure seems to! We all want to belong&#x2014;that need to be connected to others is an inherent desire. We live our entire lives trying to fit in, be known, attract acceptance, and experience intimacy. We desperately want to have others care about us. This book is about that hunger.

Once a woman finds reasonably good friends, going deeper can prove difficult, particularly if several friends regularly spend time together. Nelson, a public speaker and the founder of www.girlfriendcircles.com, has a solution for women in search of close, lifelong friends and offers these clueless friends-to-be advice on what to do to make existing relationships more meaningful: all parsed down as time, respect, ""sharing questions"" and direct honesty. Nelson&#x2019;s platonic girlfriend-matching website plays second fiddle here; this tome is a stand-alone compendium of tips, research, and wisdom that will help women who want more from their friendships with other women. She refrains from excessive pop psychology, outlines important distinctions in otherwise mundane concepts like &#x201c;forgiveness&#x201d;, and readers will learn about her central model of &#x201c;frientimacy&#x201d;. Much of the advice is original and of Nelson&#x2019;s own design and readers will be pleasantly surprised by the depth of her knowledge about what makes healthy friendships work.

Place 3 or 4 small plates in the freezer. <br><br>2. Peel, trim, and grate the carrots, using a food processor. Remove from the food processor bowl and set aside. You will have about 6 cups. <br><br>3. Halve and seed the orange and lemon. Cut the citrus into chunks, add to the food processor bowl, and pulse until pureed. Remove from the food processor bowl and set aside. <br><br>4. Peel and slice the ginger. Add to the food processor bowl and pulse until pureed. You will have about 1 cup. <br><br>5. In a large preserving pot, gently combine the carrots, orange and lemon, ginger, water, and orange juice. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then decrease the heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes. Turn off the heat and let it sit, uncovered, for 1 hour. <br><br>6. Add the sugar and 3 to 4 tablespoons of the lemon juice and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Turn off the heat and let sit, uncovered, for 30 minutes. <br><br>7. Place a baking sheet on the counter near your stove. Heat a kettle of water. Set two stockpots on the stove and fill them with enough water to cover the jars by 1 to 2 inches. Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat. Sterilize the jars (see page 32) in the water bath. <br><br>8. Taste the jam and stir in the remaining 3 to 4 tablespoons of lemon juice as needed. If the ginger is too mild, add a pinch of ground ginger or hot pepper. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat; then decrease the heat to low and simmer the jam for a few minutes longer, until it thickens <br> and passes the plate test (see page 30), achieving a soft set and mounding on the plate. It should be syrupy, not dry. Remove the pot from the heat. <br><br>9. Bring the water bath back to a boil. If the jars have cooled, warm them in the water bath or in a 200�F oven. Simmer the lids in a saucepan of hot water. Place the jars on the baking sheet. <br><br>10. Ladle the jam into the jars, leaving 1&#x2044;4-inch headspace. Wipe the rims clean and set the lids on the mouths of the jars. Twist on the rings. <br><br>11. Using a jar lifter, gently lower the jars into the pots. When the water returns to a boil, decrease the heat to an active simmer, and process the jars for 15 minutes. Turn off the heat and leave the jars in the water for 1 to 2 minutes. <br><br>12. Using the jar lifter, transfer the jars from the pots to the baking sheet and let sit for at least 6 hours, until cool enough to handle. Check to be sure the jars have sealed (see page 34). Label and store the sealed jam for 6 months to 2 years. Once open, store in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.</p><h2>Saxons, Vikings, and Celts: The Genetic Roots of Britain and Ireland</h2><p><p><strong>From the best-selling author of <em>The Seven Daughters of Eve</em>, a perfect book for anyone interested in the genetic history of Britain, Ireland, and America.</strong></p> One of the world's leading geneticists, Bryan Sykes has helped thousands find their ancestry in the British Isles. <em>Saxons, Vikings, and Celts</em>, which resulted from a systematic ten-year DNA survey of more than 10,000 volunteers, traces the true genetic makeup of the British Isles and its descendants, taking readers from the Pontnewydd cave in North Wales to the resting place of the Red Lady of Paviland and the tomb of King Arthur. This illuminating guide provides a much-needed introduction to the genetic history of the people of the British Isles and their descendants throughout the world.</p><p>Bryan Sykes, professor of human genetics at Oxford University, pioneered the use of DNA in exploring the human past. He is the author of Saxons, Vikings, and Celts and the&nbsp;New York Times bestseller The Seven Daughters of Eve.This work concerns a decade-long study of several thousand volunteers from Britain, Ireland, and the U.S. Sykes wished to compile a genetic history of the British Isles from DNA evidence, and in that he did succeed. Interweaving historical accounts of the Isles with accounts from his own study, he finds that much of accepted history is wrong. The choice of Dick Hill to read this meandering work may not be the best fit. His voice is fine but does not quite mesh with this production. His rhythm and pace are rather disjointed. This characteristic makes the work hard to follow, and the listener can quickly lose interest.

Increasingly, though, the disconnect between the chaos of world events and the response at home took on pressing urgency for her. Seeking to understand the Muslim world that had been reduced to scaremongering headlines, she moved to Istanbul.</p><p>Hansen arrived in Istanbul with romantic ideas about a mythical city perched between East and West, and with a na�ve sense of the Islamic world beyond. Over the course of her many years of living in Turkey and traveling in Greece, Egypt, Afghanistan, and Iran, she learned a great deal about these countries and their cultures and histories and politics. But the greatest, most unsettling surprise would be what she learned about her own country&#x2015;and herself, an American abroad in the era of American decline. It would take leaving her home to discover what she came to think of as the two Americas: the country and its people, and the experience of American power around the world. She came to understand that anti-Americanism is not a violent pathology. It is, Hansen writes, &#x201c;a broken heart . . .

It was a sound wired into a game ranger&#x2019;s psyche. Then came a burst . . . crack-crack-crack. Flocks of squawking birds scrambled, silhouetted in the crimson sunset.</p><p>Poachers. On the west boundary.</p><p>David, my ranger, was already sprinting for the trusty old Land Rover. I grabbed a shotgun and followed, leaping into the driver&#x2019;s seat. Max, my brindle Staffordshire bull terrier, scrambled onto the seat between us. With all the excitement buzzing he was not going to be left behind.</p><p>As I twisted the ignition key and floored the accelerator, David grabbed the two-way radio.</p><p>&#x2018;Ndonga!&#x2019; he bellowed. &#x2018;Ndonga, are you receiving? Over!&#x2019;</p><p>Ndonga was the head of my Ovambo guards and a good man to have on your side in a gunfight, having served in the military. I would have felt better knowing him and his team were on their way but only static greeted David&#x2019;s attempts to contact him. We powered on alone.</p><p>Poachers had been the scourge of our lives since my fianc�e Fran�oise and I bought Thula Thula, a magnificent game reserve in central Zululand. They had been targeting us for almost a year now. I couldn&#x2019;t work out who they were or where they were coming from. I had talked often with the izinduna &#x2013; headmen &#x2013; of the surrounding rural Zulu tribes and they were adamant that their people were not involved. I believed them. Our employees were mainly local and exceptionally loyal. These thugs had to be from somewhere else.</p><p>Twilight was darkening fast and I slowed as we approached the western fence and killed the headlights. Pulling over behind a large anthill, David was first out as we eased through a cluster of acacia trees, nerves on edge, trigger fingers tense, watching and listening. Tightly choked pump-action scatterguns with heavy pellets were our weapons of choice against poachers, for in the dark, in the bush, things are about as close and personal as you can get. As any game ranger in Africa knows, professional poachers will shoot first and shoot to kill.</p><p>The fence was just fifty yards away. Poachers like to keep their escape route open and I made a circling motion with my arm to David. He nodded, knowing exactly what I meant. He would keep watch while I crawled to the fence to cut off the retreat if a firefight erupted.</p><p>An acrid whiff of cordite spiced the evening air. It hung like a shroud in the silence. In Africa the bush is never willingly mute; the cicadas never cease. Except after gunshots.</p><p>After a few minutes of absolute stillness, I knew we had been set up. I switched on my halogen torch, sweeping its beam up and down the fence. There were no gaps revealing where a poacher could have cut his way in. David flicked on his torch as well, searching for tracks or blood spoor indicating if an animal had been killed and dragged off.</p><p>Nothing. Just an eerie silence.</p><p>With no tracks inside the reserve I realized the shots must have been fired from just outside the fence.</p><p>&#x2018;Damn, it&#x2019;s a decoy.&#x2019;</p><p>As I said that, we heard more shots &#x2013; muffled but distinctive &#x2018;crumps&#x2019; on the far side of the reserve, at least forty-five minutes&#x2019; drive on dirt tracks that often are little more than quagmires in the spring rains.</p><p>We jumped back into the Land Rover and sped off, but I knew it was hopeless. We had been taken for suckers. We would never catch them. They would be off the reserve with a couple of slain nyala &#x2013; one of Africa&#x2019;s most beautiful antelopes &#x2013; before we got near.</p><p>I cursed my foolhardiness. If I had only sent some rangers to the far side instead of charging off blindly, we could have caught them red-handed.</p><p>But this proved one thing. I now knew for certain the izindunas who had been claiming my problems were internal &#x2013; someone operating within the reserve &#x2013; were spot on. This was not the local community&#x2019;s work. It was not a few hungry tribesmen and scrawny dogs hunting for the pot. This was a well-organized criminal operation led by someone who followed our every move. How else could they have timed everything so perfectly?</p><p>It was pitch-dark when we arrived at the eastern perimeter of the reserve and we traced the scene with our torches. The tracks told the story. Two nyala had been taken with high-velocity hunting rifles. We could see the flattened bloodstained grass from where their carcasses were dragged to a hole in the fence, which had been crudely hacked with bolt cutters. About ten yards outside the fence were the studded muddy tracks of a 4�4 bush vehicle that by now would be several miles away. The animals would be sold to local butchers who would use them for biltong, a dried meat jerky that is much prized throughout Africa.</p><p>The light of my torch picked up a bloody tuft of charcoal-grey fur fluttering on the cut fence wire. At least one of the dead bucks was a male &#x2013; the female nyala is light brown with thin white stripes on her back.</p><p>I shivered, feeling old and weary. Thula Thula had been a hunting ranch before I had bought it and I had vowed that would end. No animal would be needlessly killed again on my watch. I didn&#x2019;t realize how difficult that vow would be to keep.</p><p>Despondently we drove back to the lodge. Fran�oise greeted us with mugs of dark, rich coffee. Just what I needed.</p><p>I glanced at her and smiled my thanks. Tall, graceful and very French, she was just as beautiful as the day I had first met her catching a taxi on a freezing London morning twelve years ago.</p><p>&#x2018;What happened?&#x2019; she asked.</p><p>&#x2018;A set-up. There were two groups. One fired some shots on the far boundary, then watched our Land Rover lights. As soon as we got there, the others bagged two buck on the eastern side.&#x2019;</p><p>I took a gulp of coffee and sat down. &#x2018;These guys are organized; someone&#x2019;s going to get killed if we&#x2019;re not careful.&#x2019;</p><p>Fran�oise nodded. Three days ago the poachers had been so close it felt as if their bullets were whistling a fraction above our heads.</p><p>&#x2018;Better report it to the cops tomorrow,&#x2019; she said.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t reply. To expect the police to pay much attention to two murdered antelope was pushing it a little.</p><p>Ndonga was furious the next morning when I told him that more animals had been shot. He admonished me for not calling him. I said we had tried but failed to get a response.</p><p>&#x2018;Oh . . . sorry, Mr Anthony. I went out for a few drinks last night. Not feeling too good today,&#x2019; he said, grinning sheepishly.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t feel like discussing his hangover. &#x2018;Can you make this a priority?&#x2019; I asked.</p><p>He nodded. &#x2018;We&#x2019;ll catch these bastards.&#x2019;</p><p>I had barely got back to the house when the phone rang. A woman introduced herself: Marion Gara� from the Elephant Managers and Owners Association (EMOA), a private organization comprised of several elephant owners in South Africa that takes an interest in elephant welfare. I had heard of them and the good work they did for elephant conservation before, but as I was not an elephant owner, I had never dealt with them directly.</p><p>Her warm voice instantly inspired empathy.</p><p>She got straight to the point. She had heard about Thula Thula and the variety of magnificent indigenous Zululand wildlife that we had. She said she had also heard of how we were working closely with the local population in fostering conservation awareness and wondered . . . would I be interested in adopting a herd of elephant? The good news, she continued before I could answer, was that I would get them for free, barring capture and tra</p></p><h2>Be Delivered (Exodus): Finding Freedom by Following God (The BE Series Commentary)</h2><p><p><b>Getting free is only half the story</b></p><b>&nbsp;</b>Freedom is a central theme in our world.

Hays maps the shocking ways the four Gospel writers interpreted Israel's Scripture to craft their literary witnesses to the Church's one Christ. The Gospels' scriptural imagination discovered inside the long tradition of a resilient Jewish monotheism a novel and revolutionary Christology.</p><p>Modernity's incredulity toward the Christian faith partly rests upon the characterization of early Christian preaching as a tendentious misreading of the Hebrew Scriptures. Christianity, modernity claims, twisted the Bible they inherited to fit its message about a mythological divine Savior. The Gospels, for many modern critics, are thus more about Christian doctrine in the second and third century than they are about Jesus in the first.</p><p>Such Christian "misreadings" are not late or politically motivated developments within Christian thought. As Hays demonstrates, the claim that the events of Jesus' life, death, and resurrection took place "according to the Scriptures" stands at the very heart of the New Testament's earliest message. All four canonical Gospels declare that the Torah and the Prophets and the Psalms mysteriously prefigure Jesus. The author of the Fourth Gospel puts the claim succinctly: "If you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote about me" (John 5:46).</p><p>Hays thus traces the reading strategies the Gospel writers employ to "read backwards" and to discover how the Old Testament figuratively discloses the astonishing paradoxical truth about Jesus' identity. Attention to Jewish and Old Testament roots of the Gospel narratives reveals that each of the four Evangelists, in their diverse portrayals, identify Jesus as the embodiment of the God of Israel. Hays also explores the hermeneutical challenges posed by attempting to follow the Evangelists as readers of Israel's Scripture&#x2015;can the Evangelists teach us to read backwards along with them and to discern the same mystery they discovered in Israel's story?</p><p>In <i>Reading Backwards</i> Hays demonstrates that it was Israel's Scripture itself that taught the Gospel writers how to understand Jesus as the embodied presence of God, that this conversion of imagination occurred early in the development of Christian theology, and that the Gospel writers' revisionary figural readings of their Bible stand at the very center of Christianity.</p></p><p><p>Richard B. Hays (Ph.D., Emory University) is George Washington Ivey Professor of New Testament, Duke Divinity School. His publications include <i>Echoes of Scripture in the Gospels </i>(2016), <i>Reading the Bible Intertextually</i> (edited with Stefan Alkier and Leroy A. Huizenga, 2009) and <i>Revelation and the Politics of Apocalyptic Interpretation </i>(edited with Stefan Alkier, 2012).</p><p>Twenty-five years ago Richard Hays launched a quiet but highly effective revolution on how Paul read Israel&#x2019;s scripture. Now he turns his attention to the four gospels, and we may confidently predict similar results. With his characteristic blend of biblical and literary scholarship, Hays opens new and striking vistas on texts we thought we knew&#x2015;and, particularly, on the early church&#x2019;s remarkable belief in Jesus as the embodiment of Israel&#x2019;s God.</p> (N.T. Wright, Professor of New Testament and Early Christianity, University of St Andrews)<br><br><p>Few people are better qualified than Hays to take us right inside the ways the Gospels interpret the Old Testament. And, as though that were not enough for one short book, his hermeneutical quest also delivers a christological result. He shows how, precisely in their reading of the Old Testament, each of the Gospels in its own distinctive way presents Jesus as the very embodiment of the God of Israel. Intertextuality and high christology turn out to be two sides of a coin.</p> (Richard Bauckham, Emeritus Professor, University of St Andrews)<br><br><p>Hays&#x2019; thesis is as simple as it is ground-shifting: that the Gospel writers&#x2019; portraits of Jesus depend on their hermeneutical appropriation of Israel&#x2019;s Scripture. And his approach is disarmingly straightforward: a sympathetic reading of the Gospels calibrated to hear both explicit and implicit scriptural resonances. With transparent exegesis and lucid prose, Hays persuasively challenges some of the basic assumptions and arguments in modern biblical studies.</p> (Joel B.

Whether used as a reference or a beautiful keepsake, it's a very worthy addition to the world of Mah Jongg." &#x2014;Ruth Unger, President, <i>National Mah Jongg League</i></b><br><br>This is the first book to fully capture the story of the exotic and exciting game of Mahjong or "Mah Jongg," offering an intimate look at the history of the game as well as the visual beauty of the tiles. When authors Ann Israel and Gregg Swain began playing Mahjong, they were unaware of the vintage collections that existed not only in the United States but also across the globe. Slowly, they started to collect their own sets of Mahjong and as their collections grew, so did their appreciation of the history of, and interest in, the game.<br><br>Finding few references, Israel and Swain set out to create a book that chronicles the early beginnings of the game and documents Mahjong sets from the most basic, made of paper, to the most precious materials such as ivory and mother-of-pearl. Recognized and respected scholars and game experts have collaborated with Israel and Swain, contributing essential chapters on the game's history and its pieces as well as technical information on the tiles. Lastly, prominent collectors from around the globe have shared their incredible sets and memories for the first time in one book for everyone to enjoy.<br><br>With hundreds of beautiful new images by renowned photographer Michel Arnaud, and including historical documentation and ephemera, <i>Mah Jongg: The Art of the Game</i> fills the void between the past's and today's game, providing vision, inspiration and resources. Anyone who has ever been intrigued by a Mahjong tile will find in these pages visually stunning photographs that will entice them into becoming an enthusiast of the timeless game of Mahjong.</p><p><b>Ann Israel</b> grew up in Detroit and now lives in New York City.

For too long, we the people have sat by and let politicians and bureaucrats from both parties obfuscate and lie. And according to this former Navy SEAL, former pro wrestler, and former Minnesota governor, the media is complicit in these acts of deception.

In Ventura&#39;s eyes, the murder of Abraham Lincoln and the assassinations of the Kennedys and Martin Luther King all need to be reexamined. Was Watergate presented honestly, or was the CIA involved? Did the Republican Party set out to purposefully steal two elections on behalf of George W. Bush?

People appreciated the money the cowboys spent but thought them too coarse to be near their homes. Enticed to come calling by Linda McDonald, daughter of one of the leading citizens, Tom Lundy broke the law and crossed the line. Later that night, he was dead. <br><br>Outraged by her brother&#x2019;s murder, Kate vows to destroy the entire town. But when Aaron McDonald sends east for an army of hired guns, Conn Dury and the men of the Tumbling B soon wonder if the price of Kate&#x2019;s revenge is too high.</p><p>It was no crime for a young cowboy to want to talk to a pretty girl, but that was what got Tom Lundy killed.

But Kate Lundy, the Tumbling B&#39;s owner, had a better plan.

When a family friend suddenly dies in a plane crash, the Austins open their home to an orphaned girl, Maggy Hamilton. The Austin children&#x2015;Vicky, John, Suzy, and Rob&#x2015;do their best to be generous and welcoming to Maggy.</p><p>Vicky knows she should feel sorry for Maggy, but having sympathy for Maggy is no easy thing. Maggy is moody and spoiled; she breaks toys, wakes people in the middle of the night screaming, discourages homework, and generally causes chaos in the Austin household.

Adjusting to a new household member is not easy, as the 12-year-old narrator, Vicky, will testify. Maggy is spoiled, "ubiquitous," laughs in a "horrid, screechy way," and appears to be a child of an entirely different species from the thoughtful, intelligent, kind, yet not cloyingly so, Austin kids. Still, Vicky and her other siblings (Rob, Suzy, and John) grit their collective teeth and struggle to understand her, which becomes easier and easier as the loving family seems to rub off on the newly orphaned Maggy.<p> The Austins are beyond question a charming family, but their path is by no means rock-free: Vicky sneaks off to a friend's house and severely injures herself in a bike accident, they all get the measles, John is beat up after his guest sermon in church, and they almost lose little Rob. Despite ordinary family setbacks, there's no use pretending this is a run-of-the-mill family. When Vicky is sick, her older brother, John, comes into her room and soothes her with a discussion of the solar system, our atomic composition, and the relativity of size. Family dinner-table talk includes the ethics of meat eating, and a chat with Grandfather ends up with a discussion of whether Einstein believed in God. As in all of L'Engle's novels, she asks the big questions: What is the meaning of life, and how does death fit into that? Are there different kinds of intelligence? What happens when you remove a screw from a radiator? This strangely comforting novel, first published in 1960, is an ALA Notable Book, and was followed by four other books featuring the Austin Family: <i>The Moon by Night</i>, <i>The Young Unicorns</i>, <i>A Ring of Endless Light</i> (a Newbery Honor Book), and <i>Troubling a Star</i>. (Ages 9 to 12) <i>--Karin Snelson</i></p>The moment Maggy Hamilton steps into the happy lives of the Austin family, she disrupts their harmonious world, bringing with her all the sullenness and insolence of her own misery.<p></p><p>Vicky Austin knows she should sympathize with Maggy for being an orphan, but she can't help but resent her for making life so difficult. It looks like Maggy may be a member of the family for a long time, possibly forever. Vicky remembers the happy times and finally accepts that things will never be the same, but she wonders what's to come.</p></p><h2>Lessons My Father Taught Me: The Strength, Integrity, and Faith of Ronald Reagan</h2><p>"I know in my heart that man is good.

For all Christian denominations and perfect for families to share throughout the year, this book will be especially beloved by the faithful as a gift for Easter, communions, christenings, religious graduations, and all other secular holidays.<br> &nbsp;<br> This book freshly reinterprets some of the oldest and best-known stories in human history and focuses on some of the many miracles that Jesus performed before his crucifixion. Jesus&#x2019;s miracles are endless. From the large harvest of fish to washing the unclean, healing the sick, feeding the poor, and walking on water, Jesus performs feats that draw in believers that he is the Son of God. Unfortunately it also attracts the attention of nonbelievers, who saddle him with the cross he must bear. After all of his miraculous acts, the book closes with a final wonder for all to see&#x2014;one that changes faith and religion as the world knows it, forever. The book includes a list of Bible stories that inspired it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Award-winning author and illustrator John Hendrix offers his most personal work to date. Known for his striking use of illustration mixed with custom fonts, his depiction of the life of Jesus Christ will be cherished by the faithful everywhere.</p><p><b>John Hendrix</b> wrote and illustrated the critically acclaimed nonfiction picture books <i>John Brown</i>, which earned three starred reviews, <i>Shooting at the Stars</i>, which earned four starred reviews, and the activity book <i>Drawing Is Magic</i>; he also illustrated the award-winning <i>Nurse, Soldier, Spy</i> by Marissa Moss and the transportation tale <i>McToad Mows Tiny Island</i> by Tom Angleberger. He lives in St. Louis, Missouri. www.johnhendrix.com.K-Gr 3-Through selected Gospel stories and bold pen-and-ink illustrations, Hendrix portrays the miraculous life of Jesus in this unique retelling. Employing simple, child-friendly language, the author reveals how Jesus "was like none who had lived before" and how his words "made things happen." Hendrix demonstrates how, while performing a series of miracles including healing the sick, feeding thousands with a meager supply of loaves and fishes, calming the stormy seas, and walking on water, Jesus gathered crowds of followers and attracted enemies, who didn't approve of the adulation he garnered. Although Jesus was ultimately betrayed and sent to die, in the end, he was able to perform "one last glorious miracle." Hendrix embeds hand-lettering into his drawings, and the design and format of the spreads call to mind modern graphic novels. Despite the contemporary feel of the artwork and language, the illustrations are also replete with historically accurate details of life in biblical times. The doubt and fear of the disciples as they cross the sea with Jesus in a tiny boat is evident in a striking spread dominated by the rain-swept ocean and accompanied by the question "Don't you care if we die?" VERDICT Hendrix eloquently conveys the life-changing power of faith in this distinctive snapshot of the life and teachings of Jesus, providing an appealing introduction to more complete collections of Bible stories.-Linda L.

This &#x201c;Switzerland of the Americas&#x201d; is widely regarded as an oasis of democracy in turbulent Central America. Since the first edition of <i>Culture Smart! Costa Rica </i>was published in 2005, however, there have been some important changes and, with rapid economic development, some growing pains. Over the past few years there has been a movement of population to the towns of the Central Valley. Higher education is now the norm for young Ticos, and the middle class has expanded&#x2014;but so has the gap between rich and poor. Tourism took a dive after the 2009 recession, and the national debt has grown, while the arrival of multinationals and significant Chinese investment has been welcomed. Unemployment has risen, people are prepared to go on strike more readily, and there is a general disillusionment with politicians. In the face of mounting difficulties the Ticos remain remarkably peaceable, relaxed, and fun-loving. Their enthusiasm for life is seen as much in their passion for soccer as in their demonstrations in support of human and political rights.<i> Culture Smart!

It also offers a thought-provoking look at the consequences of unleashing power beyond human control. The afterword discusses the legend of the golem and its roots in the history of the Jews. A Caldecott Medal Book.</p><p>Golem is the Hebrew word for shapeless man. According to Jewish legend, the renowned scholar and teacher Rabbi Loew used his powers to create a Golem from clay in order to protect his people from persecution in the ghettos of 16th-century Prague. (This was the time of the Blood Lie, when hostile gentiles claimed that Jews were mixing the blood of Christian children with the flour and water of matzo.) David Wisniewski's cut-paper collage illustrations--which earned him the Caldecott Medal in 1997--are the ideal medium for portraying the stark black-and-white forces of good and evil, pride and prejudice, as well as the gray area that emerges when the tormented clay giant loses control of his anger. Echoing the tension and mood of Frankenstein, Wisniewski sends the tragic giant back to the blood red earth that birthed him. The historical note on the last page offers a broader context for the legend, ultimately comparing the creation of Golem to the emergence of Israel. (Ages 8 and older) <i>--Gail Hudson</i>David Wisniewski (wiz-NESS-key) was born in Middlesex, England, in 1953. After training at Ringling Brothers and Barnum &amp; Bailey Clown College, he spent three years as a clown, designing and constructing his own props, costumes, and gags. He was subsequently hired by his future wife, Donna, as a performer with a traveling puppet theatre. Married six months later, the Wisniewskis started their own troupe, Clarion Shadow Theatre, specializing in shadow puppetry. In the course of creating the plays, puppets, and projected scenery, Mr. Wisniewski evolved the storytelling techniques and art skills that eventually led to his picture books with their unique cut-paper illustrations. His retelling of GOLEM was awarded the 1997 Caldecott Medal. David Wisniewski died in 2002 in the Maryland home he shared with his wife and two children.</p><h2>The Carroll Shelby Story: Portrayed by Matt Damon in the Hit Film Ford v Ferrari</h2><p><p><strong>Carroll Shelby wasn't born to run.

Delving further back into human history and deeper into the human psyche than <i>Serial Killers</i>--Vronsky's 2004 book, which has been called the definitive history of serial murder--he focuses strictly on sexual serial killers: thrill killers who engage in murder, rape, torture, cannibalism and necrophilia, as opposed to for-profit serial killers, including hit men, or "political" serial killers, like terrorists or genocidal murderers.<br><br>These sexual serial killers differ from all other serial killers in their motives and their foundations.

A regional bestseller, this collaborative project between the council, Oregon tribes, and scholars served as an invaluable reference for teachers, scholars, and general-interest readers before it went out of print in 1996. Now revised and expanded for a new generation of Oregonians, The First Oregonians provides a comprehensive view of Oregon&#x2019;s native peoples from the past to the present. In this remarkable volume, Oregon Indians tell their own stories, with more than half of the book&#x2019;s chapters written by members of Oregon&#x2019;s nine federally recognized tribes. Chapters on each tribe examine lifeways&#x2014;from the traditional to the present day. Using oral histories and personal recollections, these chapters vividly depict not only a history of decimation and decline, but also a contemporary view of cultural revitalization, renewal, and continuity. The First Oregonians also includes essays exploring geography, federal-Indian relations, language, and art written by prominent Northwest scholars. And, as with the first edition, this new edition is richly illustrated with almost two hundred photographs, maps, and drawings. No other book offers as wide a variety of views and stories about the historical and contemporary experience of Oregon Indians. The First Oregonians is the definitive volume for all Oregonians interested in the fascinating story of Oregon&#x2019;s first peoples.</p><p>Laura van den Berg is the author of two collections of stories: What the World Will Look Like When All the Water Leaves Us, a Barnes &amp; Noble Discover Great New Writers selection, and The Isle of Youth, recipient of the Rosenthal Family Foundation Award for Fiction from the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

Thirteen rhyming couplets spin the story of two siblings and their pet gazelle who sneak past their father, board a small boat, and follow a stream into a mysterious underworld to search for a treasure. Skillful narrative and visual storytelling combine to present a complex adventure that unravels through multilayered text and illustrations, challenging readers to ponder the numerous levels of plot. When the sister is tempted ashore by villains holding candy and captured, her brother follows in hot pursuit, rushing through a labyrinth realm filled with pirates, monsters, trolls, and other fearsome creatures. Youngsters can mull over questions about the nature of the treasure seeking (the cache turns out to be pretty unappealing) and why W precedes V in the alphabet sequence ("warnings" before "vile deeds"). The gothic illustrations, done in sepia tones and faded color washes, ensure that readers remain riveted throughout the story, since there are spine-chilling details at every turn.

David Talbot describes a JFK administration more besieged by domestic enemies than has been previously realized, from within the Pentagon, the CIA, the FBI, and the mob. It is against this dark backdrop that he charts the emotionally charged journey of Robert Kennedy, whose soul-scouring quest to find the origins of his brother&#x2019;s murder led him, to his horror, back to the dark corners of American power that had been part of his portfolio: U.S. intelligence, Cuba, and organized crime.<br> <br>From the Kennedy &#x201c;band of brothers&#x201d; to RFK&#x2019;s hope of using executive power to solve Jack&#x2019;s death once and for all, this probing work of history draws on more than 150 exclusive interviews to produce a bold look at power and vengeance. A topic of perennial interest, Brothers is a multilayered, complex tale of gut-wrenching history.</p><p>David Talbot, author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Brothers: The Hidden History of the Kennedy Years</i>, is the founder and CEO of <i>Salon</i>. He lives in San Francisco.<b><p> 1 </p></b><p><b> NOVEMBER 22, 1963 </b> </p><p> Like all Americans who lived through that day, Robert F. Kennedy never forgot how he heard his brother had been shot. The attorney general, who had just turned thirty- eight, was eating lunch -- clam chowder and tuna sandwiches -- with United States Attorney Robert Morgenthau and his assistant by the pool at Hickory Hill, his Civil War-era mansion in McLean, Virginia, outside the capital. It was a perfect fall day -- the kind of bright, crisp Friday afternoon that makes a weekend seem full of promise -- and the grounds of the rolling green estate were afl ame with gold and red leaves from the shedding hickories, maples, and oaks that stood sentry over the property. Kennedy had just emerged from a mid- day swim, and as he talked and ate with the visiting lawmen, his trunks were still dripping. </p><p> Around 1:45 p.m., the phone extension at the other end of the pool rang. Kennedy's wife, Ethel, picked it up -- she held the receiver out to him. J. Edgar Hoover was calling. Bobby knew immediately something unusual had happened. The FBI director never phoned him at home. The two men regarded each other with a taut wariness that they both knew would only be broken when one of them left office. Each represented to the other what was wrong about America. "I have news for you," Hoover said. "The president's been shot." Hoover's voice was blunt and matter of fact. Kennedy would always remember not just the FBI chief 's words, but his chilling tone. </p><p> "History cracked open" for America on November 22, 1963, as playwright Tony Kushner observed years later. But the abyss that opened for Bobby Kennedy at that moment was the deepest of all. And it was Hoover, of all people, who brought him news of the apocalypse. "I think he told me with pleasure," Kennedy would recall. </p><p> Twenty minutes later, Hoover phoned again to deliver the final blow: "The president's dead," he said and promptly hung up. Again, Kennedy would remember, his voice was oddly flat -- "not quite as excited as if he were reporting the fact that he had found a Communist on the faculty of Howard University." </p><p> Hoover's curt phone calls confirmed that the "perfect communion" between the two brothers, as the <i>New York Times</i>' Anthony Lewis described the bond between President John Kennedy and Robert Kennedy -- a fraternal relationship unprecedented in presidential history -- was over. But they also clearly conveyed that Bobby had suffered a death of a different kind. His own power as attorney general instantly started to fade, already to a point where the director of the FBI no longer felt compelled to show deference, or even common human grace, to his superior in the Justice Department. </p><p> For the rest of the day and night, Bobby Kennedy would wrestle with his howling grief -- crying, or fighting against crying since that was the Kennedy way -- while using whatever power was still left him, before the new administration settled firmly into place, to figure out what had really happened in Dallas. He worked the phones at Hickory Hill; he met with a succession of people while waiting for Air Force One to return with the body of his brother, his brother's widow, and the new president; he accompanied his brother's remains to the autopsy at Bethesda Naval Hospital; and he stayed coiled and awake in the White House until early the next morning. Lit up with the clarity of shock, the electricity of adrenaline, he constructed the outlines of the crime. </p><p> From his phone calls and conversations that day -- and into the following week -- it's possible to trace the paths that Robert Kennedy pursued as he tried to unveil the mystery. "With that amazing computer brain of his, he put it all together on the afternoon of November 22," his friend, journalist Jack Newfi eld, remarked. </p><p> RFK's search for the truth about the crime of the century has long been an untold story. But it is deeply loaded with historic significance. Kennedy's investigative odyssey -- which began with a frantic zeal immediately after his brother's assassination, and then secretly continued in fitful bursts until his own murder less than five years later -- did not succeed in bringing the case to court. But Robert Kennedy was a central figure in the drama -- not only as his brother's attorney general and the second most powerful official in the Kennedy administration, but as JFK's principal emissary to the dark side of American power. And his hunt for the truth sheds a cold, bright light on the forces that he suspected were behind the murder of his brother. Bobby Kennedy was America's fi rst assassination conspiracy theorist. </p><p> Predictably, the first phone call that Bobby made on November 22 after his initial conversation with Hoover was to Kenny O'Donnell. JFK's chief of staff had accompanied the president to Dallas and was with him at Parkland Memorial Hospital when he was pronounced dead at 2:00 p.m. Tough, taciturn, Boston Irish, O'Donnell was second only to Bobby himself in his political guardianship of the president. A close friend since they roomed together at Harvard and played on the college football team, O'Donnell was the man Bobby would have wanted at the scene of a crisis if he couldn't be there himself. As a B-17 bombardier, he had fl own thirty missions against Nazi Germany, was shot down and then escaped from enemy prison. In his final, legendary game as quarterback at Harvard, he ran for the winning touchdown against archrival Yale on a broken leg. </p><p> Bobby ran upstairs to phone O'Donnell from his bedroom, while Morgenthau and his assistant were led to a TV set in the drawing room at Hickory Hill. Not finding O'Donnell at the hospital, Kennedy spoke instead to Secret Service agent Clint Hill, the only offi cer who had performed heroically on the president's behalf that afternoon. Images of Hill rushing to leap onto the back of JFK's moving limousine would forever become part of the iconography of that eerie day. </p><p> It's not known precisely what Bobby learned that afternoon from the Secret Service man. But there was a darkness that immediately began growing in Hill and O'Donnell about what they'd seen and heard in Dallas. Neither man would ever be the same after November 22. </p><p> O'Donnell was riding immediately behind Kennedy's limousine in the Dallas motorcade, just ten feet away, along with fellow Boston Irishman Dave Powers, the White House aide and court jester. They were front row witnesses to the assassination. Powers would later say it felt as if they were "riding into an ambush." O'Donnell and more than one Secret Service man would tell Bobby the same thing that day: They were caught in a crossfire. It was a conspiracy. </p><p> Bobby Kennedy came to the same conclusion that afternoon. It was not a "he" who had killed his brother -- it was a "they." This is how he put it to his friend, Justice Department press spokesman Edwin Guthman. The former Pulitzer Prize-winning Seattle Times reporter had become close friends with Kennedy during the 1950s when they both put themselves on the line to investigate corruption and thuggery in the Teamsters' union. Guthman was one of Bobby's "band of brothers," as the attorney general years later inscribed a picture of his young, idealistic Justice Department team. The battle cry from Shakespeare's <i>Henry V</i> appealed to Bobby's sense of heroic mission: "We few, we happy few, we band of brothers / For he to-day that sheds his blood with me / Shall be my brother.../ And gentlemen...now a- bed / Shall think themselves accursed they were not here." If the perfect communion between Jack and Bobby was at the heart of the Kennedy administration, it was this wider circle of brothers -- all intensely devoted to the Kennedy cause -- who gave the New Frontier its blood and muscle. Bobby would quietly turn to several of these trusted aides to help him on his quest for the truth. </p><p> Guthman was having lunch with a congressman from Seattle on Capitol Hill when someone came rushing in to tell them the president had been shot. He immediately drove to Hickory Hill, where he spent the rest of the afternoon with Bobby. By now, Kennedy family members were gathering at the Virginia estate. But Bobby was also surrounding himself with "brothers" like Guthman. The two men paced endlessly together, back and forth on the backyard lawn. "There's so much bitterness I thought they would get one of us, but Jack, after all he'd been through, never worried about it," Kennedy told Guthman. </p><p> "Bob said, 'I thought they would get me, instead of the president,' " Guthman said, recalling the conversation years later. "He distinctly said 'they.'" </p><p> Guthman and others around Bobby that day thought "they" might be coming for the younger Kennedy next. So apparently did Bobby. He was normally opposed to tight security measures, which he found intrusive and perhaps even a sign of cowardice -- "Kennedys don't need bodyguards," he had said, even after he began receiving death threats as the crime-busting attorney general. But that afternoon, Kennedy allowed the Fairfax County police, who rushed to Hickory Hill after the assassination without being summoned, to protect his home. Later, the police were replaced by federal marshals, who encircled Kennedy's estate after Guthman and other RFK aides spoke to Chief U.S. Marshal Jim McShane. </p><p> Bobby trusted McShane and his men. James Joseph Patrick McShane was a street-tough Irish New York cop. He had worked with Bobby as an investigator for the Senate Rackets Committee in the late 1950s and had served as bodyguard for JFK during the presidential campaign. He and his men had put their lives on the line in the civil rights battles of the South, saving Martin Luther King Jr. from a howling mob that had surrounded a church in Montgomery, Alabama, where he was preaching in May 1961. The following year, McShane and his ragtag troops had again formed a thin, bloodied line in defense of James Meredith, the black student who set off a fiery white uprising when he enrolled at the University of Mississippi. McShane was "built like a tank, had the crushed nose of the Golden Glov...</p></p><h2>The Wizard Heir (The Heir Chronicles, 2)</h2><p><br>Sixteen-year-old Seph McCauley has spent the past three years getting kicked out of one exclusive private school after another.

Seph is a wizard, orphaned and untrained--and his powers are escalating out of control. <br><br>After causing a tragic fire at an after-hours party, Seph is sent to the Havens, a secluded boys' school on the coast of Maine. At first, it seems like the answer to his prayers. Gregory Leicester, the headmaster, promises to train Seph in magic and initiate him into his mysterious order of wizards. But Seph's enthusiasm dampens when he learns that training comes at a steep cost, and that Leicester plans to use his students' powers to serve his own dangerous agenda.<br><br>In this companion novel to the exciting fantasy <i>The Warrior Heir</i>, everyone's got a secret to keep: Jason Haley, a fellow student who's been warned to keep away from Seph; the enchanter Linda Downey, who knew his parents; the rogue wizard Leander Hastings, and the warriors Jack Swift and Ellen Stephenson.

Her nutrition column appears regularly in the Taste section of the <i>Plain Dealer</i>. Chima lives in Ohio with her husband and two sons.In this companion to The Warrior Heir (Hyperion, 2006), orphaned Seph, 16, is an untrained wizard who can fling fire from his fingertips. After one of his many accidental fires kills a friend, he&#39;s sent to a secluded boys&#39; school in Maine. The headmaster, Dr. Leicester, a powerful wizard, offers to train him. Initially, Seph agrees but then changes his mind after he&#39;s nearly forced to participate in an initiation where he&#39;s made to swear an oath to Leicester and allow him to link Seph&#39;s power to his. For refusing, Leicester tortures Seph with hallucinatory dreams that nearly drive him insane. When he finally finds a way to communicate with the outside world, Linda Downey, an enchanter, rescues him and takes him to the town of Trinity, OH, a sanctuary for wizards and other members of magical guilds. There, he meets many of the characters who appeared in the first book, including Jack Swift, Ellen Stephenson, and Leander Hastings, as well as a new character, Madison, who can draw power from wizards. Seph and his new friends must find a way to stop an impending war between the two great wizard houses. This exciting page-turner is darker than The Warrior Heir and, because of its depiction of Leicester&#39;s love of inflicting pain and frequent violence, is more appropriate for older readers.

Arellano&#x2019;s fascinating narrative combines history, cultural criticism, food writing, personal anecdotes, and Jesus on a tortilla. In seemingly every decade for over a century, America has tried new culinary trends from south of the border, loved them, and demanded the next big thing. As a result, Mexican food dominates American palates to the tune of billions of dollars in sales per year, from canned refried beans to tortilla wraps and ballpark nachos. It&#x2019;s a little-known history, one that&#x2019;s crept up on this country and left us better for it.</p><p><b>Gustavo Arellano</b>&#x2019;s <i>�Ask a Mexican! </i>column has a circulation of more than two million in thirty-eight markets (and counting).

They were astronauts on STS-128, a NASA mission that flew the Discovery space shuttle to rendezvous with the International Space Station on August 30, 2009. Discovery&#x2019;s seven-member crew spent ten days at the research station, primarily to resupply the people already up there and to rotate members. Olivas&#x2014;raised in El Paso, Texas&#x2014;went on a space walk to repair an ammonia tank, among other tasks; Hern�ndez&#x2014;who picked crops in California&#x2019;s Central Valley alongside family members as a child&#x2014;sent his thoughts to our planet en espa�ol. &#x201c;Espero la cosecha de mi sue�o sirva como inspiracion a todos!&#x201d; he enthused via Twitter. &#x201c;I hope the harvest of my dream serves as inspiration to all!&#x201d;<br> <br>On September 8, the Discovery crew undocked from the Space Station. It was morning. It was time for breakfast burritos. The rest of the crew had earlier asked Hern�ndez and Olivas if they might cook the meal, because Olivas was the NASA member who knew how to make them best. Of course. A video camera transmitted footage of the duo floating toward the galley of the middeck to open a shelf containing the ingredients needed to construct the cylindrical god in zero gravity: flour tortillas sealed in a vacuum pack, clumps of ready-to-eat scrambled eggs, and fat sausage patties.<br> <br>Olivas pulled out a tortilla, letting it float in front of him while tearing open a thumb-sized salsa packet. He smeared a smiley face on the tortilla and tried to roll it up; since it wasn&#x2019;t cooked, the flour flatbread bent into a U-shape but wobbled back into its outstretched natural state. Hern�ndez, meanwhile, opened a pouch that contained the patty. Olivas placed the tortilla near the meat, expecting the sausage to plop down on it, as it would on terra firma. Instead, the brownish, glistening mass popped out of the bag, away from the tortilla below it, and would&#x2019;ve presumably continued on an endless trajectory if the fast-thinking Olivas didn&#x2019;t snatch the sausage with the tortilla. The salsa acted as a binding agent and secured the incipient Icarus.<br> <br>The eggs proved more manageable. Hern�ndez cut them out of a packet; Olivas used a spoon to guide each minimound onto the tortilla, then promptly chopped them up into smaller pieces, the better to smush and smear&#x2014;if the tortilla might only bend. The moment of truth arrived: Olivas folded the vessel in half, wrapping one flap over the other, and rolled it tight. Success; a breakfast burrito was born, and more were on the way.<br> <br>This wasn&#x2019;t the first time burritos orbited Earth&#x2014;Olivas had made a batch on his previous visit to the Space Station two years earlier. In fact, NASA had used tortillas for astronaut sustenance as early as 1985, when Mexican scientist Rodolfo Neri Vela requested a pack as part of his food provisions, to make tacos. The media treated Neri&#x2019;s food choices at the time with bemusement, but astronauts quickly took to flour tortillas&#x2014;and not just because of the flavor, redolent of flour and slightly sweet, better than most of the sterilized slop astronauts ate. Tortillas didn&#x2019;t spoil easily. Astronauts could wrap one around anything and make a quick meal. They also weren&#x2019;t dangerous, like bread, whose crumbs crippled air vents and sensitive equipment.<br> <br>NASA took tortillas so seriously that they tinkered with the recipe&#x2014;which hadn&#x2019;t substantially changed in millennia save for the introduction of flour&#x2014;to keep stacks fresh for up to six months. Scientists created a nitrogen-filled packet that removed almost all the oxygen present in the pouch, to prevent mold from growing. One major problem arose: astronauts discovered that six-month-old space tortillas became bitter&#x2014;and no one deserves a bitter tortilla. Finally, NASA found a manufacturer who made an extended-shelf-life tortilla that lasted up to a year and retained its allure, a maker that also sold their product to fast-food titan Taco Bell. Hundreds of thousands of dollars well spent.<br> <br>&#x201c;I cannot think of anything that cannot be put on a tortilla, or has not been put on a tortilla,&#x201d; wrote Sandra Magnus, a veteran astronaut, in a blog post while up in the International Space Station in 2008. &#x201c;When a Shuttle shows up you are in tortilla heaven because they show up with tons of them and graciously donate all of the extras to the ISS crews. You really want to be swimming in tortillas your whole increment.&#x201d;1<br> <br>And for short missions of five to seven days? Astronauts often bring their flour tortillas fresh from a Houston tortiller�a&#x2014;a tortilla factory. No customizing, no chemicals&#x2014;just unadulterated rapture. The perfect food.<br> <br>&#x201c;Danny is an expert in zero-g burrito making,&#x201d; Hern�ndez radioed to Mission Control after their burrito party. It was a mission of celebration: never had two Mexican-Americans flown up in space on the same mission, and never did burritos shine so brightly. Sure, Hern�ndez and Olivas offered a service to their crewmates that hundreds of thousands of their fellow Mexican provided daily back on Earth&#x2014;prepping Mexican food for Americans more than happy to gobble it up. Their feast made the news; a video soon went viral across the Internet, the astronauts&#x2019; beaming, proud smiles as they hoisted their fast food for humanity to see. So high in the heavens, up above the world, the burrito not only had become universal&#x2014;it was now, finally, truly, cosmic.<br><br>Mexican food is at our state dinners, in elegant presentations. Mexican food is in our school cafeterias, packaged as chimichangas or in bags of Fritos, in convenience stores heating on rolling racks, waiting for the hands of hurried customers. Mexican food sponsors college bowl games such as the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl and buys naming rights for sporting venues such as the Taco Bell Arena at Boise State in Idaho. Mexican food commercials blanket television airwaves hawking salsa and hard-shelled taco packets and high-priced tequilas and imported beers promising a day at the beach. Mexican food fills our grocery aisles, feeds underclassmen, sits in our freezers and pantries, is the focus of festivals, becomes tween trends or front-page news&#x2014;and if you don&#x2019;t know what I&#x2019;m talking about, ask your kid about spaghetti tacos.<br> <br>That wonderful culinary metaphor the melting pot has absorbed Mexican in this country just like so many immigrant cuisines of the past&#x2014;but in a demanding way, unique from other traditions that have penetrated the American palate. While there are more Chinese restaurants than Mexican in this country, Mexican food is the easier sell&#x2014;you don&#x2019;t see hundreds of different soy sauce brands sold at supermarkets like you do hot sauce, or General Tso&#x2019;s chicken cook-offs at your local community fair like you do with bowls of chili. While pizza is the bestselling and farthest-reaching item of Italian-American cuisine, its rise and that of pasta and subs is only relatively recent; the United States, on the other hand, has loved Mexican food for more than 125 years&#x2014;bought it, sold it, made it, spread it, supplied it, cooked it, savored it, loved it.<br> <br>Comida mexicana in the United States is like M. C. Escher&#x2019;s Relativity, each staircase helping the climber reach a particular plateau but only to whisper promises of higher, better planes, in an endless hat dance of discovery. Americans have defined Mexican food as combo platters and enchiladas, margaritas and guacamole, tortilla chips and actual tortillas, frozen burritos and burritos made to order. Mom-and-pop shops and multinationals. Taco carts and tamale men. Taco trucks operating under cover of night and luxe-loncheras that tweet their latest specials. Beans, rice, carne asada, soyrizo. All of it absorbed by Americans, enjoyed, demanded&#x2014;and all of it whetting appetites for more. And with this country&#x2019;s latest Great Migration stretching brown folks beyond the American Southwest and to all fifty states, in virtually all metropolitan areas, from the prairies and flatlands of the Midwest to Maine&#x2019;s rocky shores, Alaska&#x2019;s tundra to the Florida Keys, we&#x2019;re experiencing a renaissance of Mexican food&#x2014;a perpetual foreigner perfectly at home.<br> <br>We&#x2019;ve had generations of Americans who scarf down tacos and burritos like previous generations forked through chicken pot pies and ate pastrami on rye. And that&#x2019;s just the United States: as globalization sets in, so does Mexican food. Mexican restaurants operate across Europe, in Turkey, in Nepal and Addis Ababa. Down under, Taco Bill&#x2019;s has sold Australians fish tacos for nearly twenty-five years. Sometimes it&#x2019;s Mexicans who run these restaurants; many times it&#x2019;s American expats. Sometimes the locals dine there, but it&#x2019;s often American tourists who patronize the places, seeking a taste of home. It&#x2019;s too easy to say Mexican food is an all-American food: to say as much is to ignore the tortured relationship between Mexicans and their adopted country. But Mexican food is as much of an ambassador for the United States as the hot dog, whether either country wants to admit it or not.<br> <br>Let me give ustedes an example. Tom Tancredo doesn&#x2019;t like Mexicans&#x2014;no way, no how, no duh. The former Colorado Republican congressman and onetime presidential candidate spent most of his political career railing against a supposed invasion of the United States by Mexico&#x2014;and while intelligent minds can disagree about unchecked migration to this country, Tancredo flat-out feels Mexicans are downright deficient.<br> <br>In November 2010, we debated in Denver about whether Mexicans ever assimilate. I maintained that we do; Tancredo didn&#x2019;t accept the possibility, yet never explained how someone like myself&#x2014;who spoke only Spanish when I entered kindergarten; was the child of two Mexican immigrants, one of whom came into this country in the trunk of a Chevy; and who now favors English and Chuck Taylor All-Stars&#x2014;did it. The back-and-forth squabble happened at Su Teatro, an old movie house now housing one of the most vibrant Chicano theaters in the United States. There is no need to go into the details of our discussion, except for one pertinent point: before lambasting Mexicans and our supposed refusal to join American society, Tancredo joined me for a Mexican dinner.<br> <br>The restaurant was across the street from Su Teatro: El Noa Noa, a large eatery that advertises itself as the Mile High City&#x2019;s &#x201c;best and most authentic Mexican restaurant.&#x201d; At night, Art Deco&#x2013;style neon lights flash the restaurant&#x2019;s name on its marquee, a reference to a legendary nightclub in Ciudad Ju�rez that was the subject of a famous Mexican song. A party on your plate. The atmosphere isn&#x2019;t aggressively ethnic: no strolling mariachis or women fluttering fans and eyelids. Eaters sit; waiters bring out a plate of chips and salsa and fetch drinks. People of all nationalities come in to eat, though the clientele leans more to American than Mexican.<br> <br>Tancredo and I sat down near the middle of the restaurant; Patty Calhoun, editor of Westword (the city&#x2019;s alternative weekly, which carries my &#x201c;�Ask a Mexican!&#x201d; column), and others joined us. We traded small talk, saving our salvos for the discussion to come&#x2014;but around us, tables whispered, fingers pointed. Some people approached our table to greet Tancredo, wish him luck for the evening. Another woman offered her appreciation for my upcoming public confrontation of someone she considered a living embodiment of Satan. She wanted to make a scene, but her chile relleno supper was getting cold.<br> <br>Our plates came. I drank tequila, of course; Tancredo, a dry red wine. He ordered the tamale dinner, hold the rice. Two of them, slathered (or, as more accurately stated in the Denver lexicon, &#x201c;smothered&#x201d;) in green chile, each as long as a palm, as thick as a copy of this book, sat before him. They shimmered with the dabs of lard needed to make a tamale moist and more than mere cornmeal and shredded pork. I stole bites of the same plate from Calhoun. Soft, spicy, filling. The pork&#x2019;s sweet essence melted on my palate; the green chile piqued toward the end. These weren&#x2019;t the tamales of my youth&#x2014;they were smaller, but that was okay. The chile&#x2014;borne from the fertile soil of southern Colorado&#x2014;seared differently from the Mexican chiles I grew up on and were so flavorful, they needed no extra salsa.<br> <br>Tancredo thought so as well. He polished off the plate, laughing and talking between each bite, getting fueled for a night to decry the very culture that had just fed him. More than a year later, I can only recall some of the points of our philosophical fisticuffs, but the scene I can&#x2019;t get out of my head is Tancredo&#x2019;s ear-to-ear, tamale-induced smile. Tom Tancredo may not like Mexicans, but he sure loves his Mexican food. Of course he does.<br><br>It&#x2019;s not just Tom who holds this contradictory position. From the early days of Mexico&#x2019;s birth in 1810, when our young country longingly looked west toward its newly christened southern neighbor&#x2019;s vast territories, lonely and so full of potential, Mexican food has entranced Americans even while Mexicans have perplexed Americans. In the history of Mexican food in this country you&#x2019;ll find the twisted, fascinating history of two peoples, Mexicans and Americans, fighting, arguing, but ultimately accepting each other, if only in the comfort of breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The greatest apostles of Mexican food in this country haven&#x2019;t been Mexicans but rather Americans who, having tasted from the bread of life that is a steaming taco, a pot of menudo, or a foil-wrapped burrito, sought to proclaim its gospel with every new unearthing. While we&#x2019;ve long quarreled with Mexico over seemingly everything, we&#x2019;ve always embraced the food, wanting to experience the &#x201c;authenticity&#x201d; of the other half: enjoying the meals Aztec emperors might have feasted on before meeting their fate, dining before handsome bronze-skinned waiters and pretty se�oritas, eating like a Mexican might eat on the street, in poverty back in Mexico, in the cantina, through cookbooks, canned products, classes, trips to the motherland or the local taquer�a&#x2014;but always within the prism of America. That consumption hasn&#x2019;t always been pretty: caricatures of hot tamales, Montezuma&#x2019;s revenge, questionable ingredients, Frito Banditos, talking Chihuahuas, and sleeping peons litter the landscape and continue to influence American perceptions of Mexican food and of Mexicans. But even negative stereotypes and digestive concerns never stopped our collective yen for the stuff.<br> <br>Mexican food&#x2019;s American journey is obviously personal to me. I consider tortillas and hot sauce as essential to life as oxygen, walk through the day with a bag of Serrano peppers in my pocket, have served as a food editor for a newspaper for nearly a decade, and have always pushed my paper to treat Mexican food seriously. My fondest childhood memories usually involve smuggled cheese wheels from my parents&#x2019; ancestral villages; my mom was a tomato canner and got up early in the morning to make us a Mexican breakfast of eggs and beans, went to work, and returned in the evening with the wherewithal to make us a full meal for dinner. Mexican food is a way of life, which isn&#x2019;t a surprise, of course. But that so many Americans, with no blood ties to Mexico, who might not even like the country,...</p><h2>Philosophy: A Christian Introduction</h2><p>Two experienced educators offer an up-to-date introduction to philosophy from a Christian perspective that covers the four major areas of philosophical thought: epistemology, metaphysics, philosophy of religion, and ethics.

They headed north, holding a sign that read ALASKA OR BUST! They arrived in Cordova nearly broke, found work together in a local cannery, and, in a month, managed to save twelve hundred dollars. They bought a twenty-foot boat for exactly that amount. They lived on it, fished off of it, and used a bucket for a toilet.It was a romantic, albeit bare-bones, beginning in the rugged little fishing village located in a wind, sprawling land bursting with boomtown opportunity and colorful characters. There was a local stripper namedTequilla, whose writhing style of dancing naked was known to cause almost a riot as lonely, affection-starved fishermen trampled one another for a closer look.Then there was Machine Gun Betty. She was a large Indian woman who worked as a bartender at a local watering hole. Her way of dealing with a rowdy crowd of drunken fishermen (who refused to leave at quitting time) was to pull out a Thompson submachine gun, level it on her rambunctious patrons, and order them off the premises. "It's closing time! Get the hell out!" she'd say as the bar emptied.During those eight years of hard work as a commercial fisherman, Skip Holden had seen some sights--such as the time the Fish and Game Department opened the season up in the fjord near Coghill Point, and he and his fishing pals had netted one million sockeye salmon in a single week of red-hot fishing.Named after Skip's wife, the F/V <i>Marlene</i> was known in fishing circles as a Snowball bow-picker. She had a six-foot-high reel mounted in the center of her foredeck. This spool-like contraption was designed to feed the one-thousand-foot-long gillnet off her bow and reel it back aboard via the same route.Along the way, Skip had learned a few things about the nature of successful fishermen, too. Foremost, he had learned not to try to be like anybody else: The best fishermen fished according to the dictates of their own personalities.As a rule, Holden worked alone. More of a hunter-type person himself, he liked to motor past the main sandbars (where most of his more conservative fellow gillnetters chose to make their "drifts") and out through the surf. He enjoyed fishing the deep waters of the open ocean. When possible, he liked to intercept the fish well before they reached the main branch of the river, something at which he was quite adept, now having the self-assurance of a seasoned fisherman, one who had paid his dues and acquired a fair amount of fishing savvy along the way.Armed with little more than a compass and a Fathometer, he roamed as far as ten miles out from the wild and ever-changing sixty-mile-wide delta of sandbars and tidelands known as the Copper RiverFlats, fishing the salmon-rich waters as far out as Cape Hinchinbrook.Some fishermen didn't like the stress of making "sets," laying out their gillnets and fishing out in the open ocean. They generally fished the inside waters. They didn't seem to mind fighting the crowds, or having to pull their gillnets back aboard every few minutes, then run back up the line, lay them out again, and start from scratch. By contrast, Skip Holden liked to fish the deep, outside waters. He liked the sight of free, open spaces and uncluttered horizons. He'd been raised that way. When he was a boy, sailing off the California coast, his father had taught him the art of navigation, as well as how to keep a ship in good repair and how to tie the rope knots that were essential to life at sea. Most important, his father instilled in his son the belief that shallow water is a fisherman's worst enemy.It was the going out and coming back in over the sandbars at entrance channels, especially those at Softuk, and Strawberry, and Egg Island, that local fishermen feared most. Let an out-rushing tide confront a strong flow of onshore wind, and the waves can really stack up.Even for Skip Holden, getting trapped out on the open sea in a sudden blow was something to be avoided if at all possible. Let him receive a warning over the local CB fishing channel announcing that the sandbar was closing, and Holden would rush his net aboard and make a mad scramble in over the building breakers before they closed him out. Once inside the punishing surf line, he would wait out the storm in the shelter of one of the tideland coves carved out of tens of miles of sandbars by the thirteen-foot tides that flooded in over the area several times each day.Miss the closing, get cut off by a sudden storm, and a fisherman would have few options, all of them dangerous. Left unprotected by island or berm, caught tens of miles from Cordova, a fisherman could either jog into the storm and weather (which might last for several days and nights) or make the near-impossible journey around the thirty-mile length of Hinchinbrook Island, running broadside to the storm winds and waves crashing ashore the entire way. Lose an engine, throw a prop, and you would be history.Regardless, Holden was always hanging it out there, working on theedge. Unlike some wanna-be fishermen, however, Holden had the touch. And during the season, it wasn't unusual for him to intercept as much as four thousand dollars' worth of the migrating fish in a single week.On that gray day in 1981, Holden had already gone for two days and nights without sleep, standing anchor watch, waiting out the past few days of blustery weather in a featureless, godforsaken reach inside Softuk Bar. It was no big deal, really. Gillnetting the flats had always been a young man's sport. And Holden could go for days without sleep. But when the winds finally did calm down, he thought, That's it. Time to go fishing, and, pulling anchor, he fled out across the bar.Once at sea, however, Holden soon found himself idling up the high, sloping faces of the unusually large swells lumbering in toward shore. Enormous as they were, the swells weren't breaking, and he drifted over them one by one, the bulging waters passing smoothly underneath him. It was the air around him, however, that spooked him. The enveloping air had turned "eerie calm, like out of breath," as he put it. It was a little like entering into the eye of a hurricane. Skip Holden had never experienced anything quite like it.Shortly, the sky grew dark, and as the unexpected storm intensified, strong winds burst up the scene. Blowing directly in against the outrushing tide, the winds soon whipped the sea into a cresting frenzy. In only minutes, thunderous breakers began collapsing across the entire width of the bar, effectively closing off any possible retreat.Still, Holden was determined to give it a try, and so he maneuvered into the roiling waters of the bar. He had managed to weave his way past several rows of breakers, when, in the gray-black of the dim evening light, he spotted a single white lightbulb mounted atop the mast of another salmon boat. Having learned of Holden's plight, a fellow fisherman had apparently left the safety of his snug anchorage and was now motoring back and forth just inside the breakers, trying to guide Holden into the deeper waters of the main channel, through at least five thousand feet of breaking waves and lathering foam.Maybe I can make it through this, thought Holden, focusing on the challenge at hand. Now, should I go around this breaker and throughthat one? he asked himself as he pushed ahead. Is it deeper there? What's my Fathometer reading? Uh-oh--too shallow. I'll try this way.Finally conceding defeat, Holden fought his way back out through the marching rows of breakers, then began motoring down the sixty-mile delta of sandbars and bordering channels.When he arrived at the channel leading past Egg Island, he found stiff seventy-mile-per-hour winds driving heavy seas ashore, and the bar closed. Without one of the powerful VHF radios on board with which to call out, he was forced to rely on the comparatively feeble power of his CB radio."Hey, Phil, what's happening?" he radioed his good friend Phil Thum. "Is there a way in? Do you see any way in there?""No, I don't think you can get in, Holden. It's breaking all the way across the bar here."The entire time he talked, Holden was jogging along the outside edge of the sandbar at the Egg Island entrance, quickly looking for an opening in the surf. Either I find my way in past Egg Island here, he thought, or I'll be out here all night. It's now or never. He cruised up and down the bar, but was unable to find anything like an opening."I really don't see any way in there," Holden radioed Thum finally."There is no way in," cut in the anonymous voice of another fisherman.And suddenly, all cross-chatter on his CB radio ceased, followed by a dead silence. Holden caught the full measure of what this meant. Everyone listening knew that there was no way back, and that in the building seas, the trip out and around Hinchinbrook Island would be pure suicide. His only hope would be to try to jog into the storm, however long it might last, however severe it might be.Well, this will be good for a laugh with my buddies back at the Reluctant Fisherman saloon in Cordova, he thought. Old Holden thought he could beat Mother Nature, and he got his butt kicked."Boy, I'm sure glad I'm safe and sound and anchored up in here," bragged another fisherman over the CB, laying it on thick."I sure wouldn't want to be out there in this kind of weather," remarked another in a tone of sincere empathy.Sometimes, Holden knew, a fisherman could find a place where he could kind of surf in where the waves weren't actually breaking. But the winds were gusting past eighty miles an hour now, and as the dark, peculiar cloud cover pressed down on him, Holden continued to motor back and forth along the outside edge of the breaking surf, praying all the while for a freak opening through which he and his boat might pass.It was then that the steering on his boat went out."Damn!" he said aloud.Suddenly caught dead in the water, Holden knew that he was in serious trouble. The winds seemed determined to blow him broadside into the Hawaiian-sized breakers now folding over and exploding with boat-crushing furor all along the mouth of the bar.He refused to let the instinct to panic have its way. Somehow, in the breaking seas and wild, punishing winds, Holden searched for a way to stabilize his boat. Like any seasoned fisherman, he knew the score: Lose the boat, lose your life.Then, cleverly, he hit upon the solution. He would play out three-quarters of his one-thousand-foot-long gillnet and, if the tide was right, catch a ride on the tidal currents as they flowed offshore and away from the breakers, all the while using the net (with the departing waters pushing against it) as a kind of sea anchor.He fed the 750-foot trail of webbing and buoys off his bow roller and watched as the offshore flow caught it. He was in luck. The tide was going out. The net, buoys, and ship were being swept out to sea and away from the pounding surf. The vessel's bow swung to point into the accelerating storm winds, exactly as he had hoped.Holden tied the net off on the ship's bow cleats to prevent the six-foot-high, four-foot-wide aluminum reel from being torn from its steel deck mounts and jerked overboard.As the darkness closed in, Holden found it difficult to see anything clearly. His eyes strained toward something in the distance. He stood squinting in the dim light, peering through the haze of rain and blowing spray. He couldn't be certain. The misty vision was either one ofbreakers demolishing themselves on nearby rocks or the flash of the buoy marker over on Wessels Reef."Holden, how are you doing out there?" radioed Phil Thum, who was anchored off in a wind-raked channel amid the barren sands of Egg Island. "Do you want me to call the Coast Guard?""Well, Phil, I'm still alive here," replied Holden. "If a Coast Guard rescue basket were to somehow land on my deck, I'd climb right in. But there's just no way a helicopter could make it out here. It's too damned windy."As the night progressed, the storm intensified and the wind pushed the waves higher. In the gathering darkness, the winds were soon hissing across the water at ninety miles per hour, with stronger gusts ranging out of wave valleys large enough to hold a football field, complete with goalposts.Getting trapped on the outside in such a blow in a relatively tiny boat (26 feet compared to one of the weather-busting king-crab boats, some of which are 150 feet long and 40 feet wide) was one of the worst experiences a Prince William Sound salmon fisherman could have.Holden was hoping that the driving wind and torrential rains would soon blow themselves out. What he could not have known was that one of the most formidable storms in the history of storm-ravaged Prince William Sound had pushed into the area, catching him flat-footed and leaving him cut off, with nowhere to run. In addition to the wicked winds, more rain would fall on the area of the Copper River Flats over the next three days in the shortest amount of time ever recorded, some fourteen inches in all.Skip Holden opened the door leading into the tiny space of his wheelhouse and quickly stepped inside. He was still dripping wet when the F/V <i>Marlene</i>'s main engine coughed heavily. Holden bent over, removed one section of the floorboard, and peered down into the small engine compartment. It was not an encouraging sight. The bilge area was full of water, which was now lapping at the sides of the gas engine.Then Holden recalled how he'd been running along with his back door left open slightly to flush out all engine fumes from inside hiscabin. Seawater, he surmised, had silently and surreptitiously been seeping in through the opening since the storm had first kicked up. The engine's carburetor and wiring were getting drenched. I need to get busy now and bail some water out of here, he told himself. I've got to shut down this engine and very methodically remove the seawater from the bilge. One thing at a time.Holden slammed the back door and tied it shut, securing the handle with a length of rope. With the engine turned off, he knew that the bilge would soon run the battery down to the point where it could no longer turn the engine over. Then all hope of somehow getting the carburetor dried out and the engine started would be lost. Holden tore away the remaining floorboards, leapt down into the chest-deep engine compartment, and immediately went to work bailing out the water. When, more than a hour later, he looked up again from his sweaty efforts, the compartment was relatively free of seawater, while outside, the dull gray evening had given way to a coal black void of blasting winds and pummeling rain.Normally, ...</p><h2>The Tales of Tiptoes Lightly</h2><p>Tiptoes Lightly lives in an acorn high up in the branches of a Great Oak Tree. One morning she finds a note lying on her floor. It says: &#34;Please help! Bee has lost his buzz!&#34; She and her friend, Jeremy Mouse, set off down Running River to help the hapless bee. Mr. Cactus, being grumpy and extra thorny, has snagged Bee&#39;s buzz on one of his thorns. Thus begins the adventure that takes Tiptoes to the house of Pine Cone and Pepper Pot (they&#39;re not at home-just yet), down to the sea to untangle Octopus (he&#39;s too young to count his legs properly and gets them mixed up), and up to Snowy Mountain to find out from Jack Frost himself whether he is a gnome (Pepper Pot says he&#39;s a gnome because he makes crystals) or a fairy (Tiptoes says he&#39;s a fairy because he flies through the air). Jack Frost tells his own creation myth which answers the question in a powerful and striking way. The &#39;Tales of Tiptoes Lightly&#39; is comprised of three adventures: &#39;The Bee who lost his Buzz&#39;, &#39;Pumpkin Crow&#39; and &#39;Lucy Goose and the Half-egg.&#39; Lavishly and lovingly illustrated by the artist-author, they are humorous, sanguine and droll.

Perhaps it&#x2019;s the French paradox, the seductive theory that a diet rich in cheese, meat, and red wine actually lowers choles�terol. Perhaps it&#x2019;s watching all those sexy French women purse their lipsticked mouths while slicing through a juicy chop.<br><br>Steak frites is a relatively easy thing to order if, like me, you&#x2019;re still struggling to master those nasal French vowels. The words fly off the tongue, without any hidden surprises&#x2014;unlike, say, asking the waiter about preservatives only to find out you&#x2019;ve interrogated him on condoms. But, as I found out during one of my first meals in a classic Paris bistro, ordering a steak leads to more questions.<br><br><i>&#x201c;Quel cuisson d�sirez-vous?&#x201d;</i> said the waiter in an offhand way, like asking my date of birth or my hair color. He wore round glasses, a white shirt with a black bow tie, and a long black apron that reached past his knees. It was difficult to discern who was older: him or the desiccated leg of ham hanging from the ceiling in the middle of the room.<br><br>Thus far I had tricked the waiter into thinking I spoke French, but now, I realized, the jig was up. Medium, I thought, and tried a quick, desperate translation. &#x201c;Uh . . . <i>moyen</i>?&#x201d;<br><br>A look of weary disappointment crossed his face. But he&#x2019;d been around enough American tourists to know what I meant. &#x201c;<i>� point,&#x201d; </i>he corrected me.<br><br>Later I would memorize all my steak vocabulary&#x2014;the hot sear and chilled interior of <i>bleu,</i> the rosy glow of <i>� point,</i> the tough brown gnaw of <i>bien cuit.</i> I would learn how to enjoy a steak the French way&#x2014;<i>saignant</i>&#x2014;with a magenta center and juices that ran red. But at that moment I just repeated the words after him and washed them down with a gulp of wine.<br><br>I&#x2019;ve wanted to live in Paris since I was six, when my family and I took a summer vacation to Europe. We went to London first, gray and proper, where we spent a week shivering into our teacups, even though it was mid-July, and I stared in terrified fascination at the Mohawked punks in Piccadilly Circus. Then we arrived in Paris, which was ablaze in a high-summer heat wave. It seemed alive, Paris, alive with warmth, and days that never ended, and beautiful people on the streets wearing beautiful clothes and speaking a beau�tiful, strange language. Every aspect of the city assailed my senses: the grand buildings in pale limestone, the parks teeming with half-naked sunbathers, the taste of baguette dipped in chocolat chaud, the seesawing sound of the sirens, the imprint of wicker caf� chairs against my sticky thighs, the Coca-Cola poured from chilled glass bottles that turned tepid without ice cubes, the smell of fresh crois�sants and ripe cheese and human sweat. It was all so new and differ�ent from the only place I really knew, our home in the sterile suburbs of Southern California. I didn&#x2019;t like everything, but it all gripped me, holding me in an embrace that I would come to know was Fran�cophilia.<br><br>The trip has gone down in Mah family lore as the nadir (or ze�nith, depending on who you&#x2019;re talking to) of my brother&#x2019;s rebellious teenage years. He spent a lot of time plugged into his Walkman while my parents coped by drinking red wine. As our voyage con�tinued, they&#x2014;my parents and brother&#x2014;seemed to grow more and more matted and worn, more impatient to return home to their own routines and clothes and space. In contrast, I became more energetic as the days passed.<br><br>&#x201c;I want to learn French,&#x201d; I proclaimed. It felt like my destiny. After all, hadn&#x2019;t my parents given me a French name, Ann Marie? They responded with wan enthusiasm, dampened even further by the sticky oppression of our hotel room. We&#x2019;d had a long week of sightseeing, my parents juggling the manic highs of their nursery�rhyme-chanting young daughter with the manic lows of their ado�lescent son. My mother considered French impractical, a pastel bonbon of a language, the linguistic equivalent of empty calories, unlike her native tongue, the useful, fibrous Mandarin Chinese. If you have any experience at all with Chinese mothers, I&#x2019;m sure it will come as no surprise that I ended up studying Mandarin.<br><br>By the time I made another trip to Paris, twenty-two years had passed. The second visit was with my husband, Calvin, who had lived there for a few years during and after college. He showed me two sides of the city&#x2014;his old haunts in Belleville, a scruffy neigh�borhood in the twentieth arrondissement, contrasted by the sweep�ing grandeur of Haussmann&#x2019;s boulevards. Unlike so many childhood memories revisited, Paris didn&#x2019;t disappoint. The city was on its best behavior during that vacation, all bright, clear June skies, a profu�sion of flowers in the Luxembourg Gardens, and unusually patient waiters who refrained from speaking English when I tried to order in French. They say you&#x2019;re supposed to be in love in Paris, and I was, headily&#x2014;with my husband, with the beautiful city, with the slim flutes of Champagne we drank while gazing at the rushing fountain on place Saint-Sulpice.<br><br>Is Paris addictive? Maybe. After that trip I abandoned all other holiday dreams. Every penny saved, every vacation week earned, was earmarked for France. We visited in the winter to shiver under covered skies that never brightened; we went in the summer to bask in the sizzle of light that stretched until eleven o&#x2019;clock at night. And each time I left, I craved more. More crusty baguettes split length�wise and spread with butter and jam. More wrought-iron balconies adorned with window-box geraniums. More Art Nouveau m�tro stations, more walks along the Seine, more surprise glimpses of Notre Dame caught from the bus.<br><br>When I wasn&#x2019;t in Paris, I sometimes dreamed of living there, of making a home in one of the ornate stone buildings that give the city such elegant propriety. What would it be like, I wondered, to be�come part of a neighborhood, to be greeted at the caf� with a hand�shake, to have the woman at the <i>boulangerie</i> prepare my baguette without asking, to commute home by crossing the Seine? I wanted to know bus routes, to have secret shortcuts, to greet neighbors with a murmured <i>&#x201c;Bonjour.&#x201d;</i> Most of all I wanted to watch the seasons change in the market, to consume and contribute to my own small patch of French <i>terroir,</i> to participate&#x2014;if only for a short window of time&#x2014;in the small, prosaic, unbroken traditions of French cuisine. I wanted to buy a galette des rois on Epiphany and chocolate bells on Easter and foie gras at Christmas. I wanted those traditions to be mine, however temporarily, even though I knew that was a dream both impractical and abstract. We had American passports, not Eu�ropean ones. How could we navigate France&#x2019;s notoriously Sisy�phean bureaucracy? How would we support ourselves without working papers? How on earth would we ever convince one of its wooden-faced civil servants to allow us to stay?<br><br>There <i>was</i> one possibility but I didn&#x2019;t believe it would ever happen. Calvin&#x2019;s career as a diplomat meant we moved often between overseas assignments&#x2014;he&#x2019;d already served in Turkmenistan, New York, Bei�jing, and D.C. Why not Paris? And yet it seemed far-fetched to hope for such a plum assignment, even though Calvin spoke fluent French and followed French politics as avidly as he did the National League baseball standings. The American embassy in Paris was one of the most desired posts in the world, often considered a reward after hard�ship tours in places like Africa or Haiti, or unaccompanied stints in war zones. But now the unbelievable had happened.<br><br>We were in rural Pennsylvania, on our way to visit Calvin&#x2019;s grandparents in State College, when we stopped for gas at a rest stop, Calvin checked his e-mail, and we discovered the good news. Later, in our motel room, I didn&#x2019;t sleep the whole night, my mind dancing with images of picnic lunches in the Luxembourg Gardens, and casual glimpses of the Eiffel Tower, and late-night ice cream cones licked while crossing the Seine. It seemed impossible to believe&#x2014; too good to be true&#x2014;that we would live in Paris, together, each with our own work that we loved. The frustration I&#x2019;d felt over the challenges of trailing-spousehood&#x2014;lack of a steady job, lack of a steady home, distance from friends and family, loss of independence and identity&#x2014;melted away with the promise of three years in Paris. Some lucky confluence of fate and aligning stars had brought us to the City of Light. Or, for me, the City of Dreams.<br><br>Before I moved to Paris, back when I was an American who fanta�sized about living there, I had an image of the perfect caf�. It had mirrored columns and a zinc bar, rattan chairs and sidewalk tables where I would nurse a glass of red wine while watching the world pass by. Grumpy waiters would serve up succulent steaks, charred on the outside, rosy within, tender enough for a knife to slip through, paired with a pile of crisp frites to mop up all the juices.<br><br>Once I got to Paris, I found out that plenty of caf�s fulfilled dif�ferent parts of my fantasy&#x2014;some had historic charm oozing out of the coffee machine, others were modern with square plates and a list of overly sweet cocktails, still others had sun-drenched <i>terrasses </i>where I could indulge in a <i>citron press� </i>on a summer afternoon. The caf� nearest to our apartment had rattan chairs and sidewalk tables; its owner, Amar, came from Tunisia, and I loved his couscous. But despite their differences, there were a few elements that tied all these caf�s together: the coffee, the wine, and the steak.<br><br>The more meals I ate in Paris, the more I wanted to know: What makes the perfect steak frites? And how did it become the town&#x2019;s favorite plat du jour?<br><br>The meal&#x2019;s basic ingredients&#x2014;beef, potatoes&#x2014;don&#x2019;t point back to Paris. Cattle are not traditionally raised in the surrounding area, and <i>frites</i>&#x2014;or French fries&#x2014;come, arguably, from Belgium. Per�haps its popularity lies in the dearth of options on a typical caf� menu, so few choices that most French people know what they&#x2019;re going to order before they even sit down. Or perhaps&#x2014;as William Bernet, a former butcher and owner of the lauded Paris steak bistro Le Severo, told me&#x2014;it&#x2019;s because of the rush of city life. &#x201c;A piece of seasoned meat, it cooks in an instant&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s fast to eat,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>Steak was brought to France by occupying English forces, some�time after the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. Even the word comes from the other side of the Channel, derived from the Old Norse <i>steikjo, </i>which means &#x201c;to roast.&#x201d; In fifteenth-century England, cooks dished up their meat sizzling, sprinkled with cinnamon, but by the time of Napoleon&#x2019;s defeat it was eaten plain, without sauce. As is true today, steaks were originally cut from the sirloin, rump, or fillet&#x2014;that is, the animal&#x2019;s loin&#x2014;though modern butchering techniques vary among countries and cultures. Talk to any butcher and he&#x2019;ll con�vince you that his method produces the best, most bountiful and tender pieces of meat.<br><br>Steak is a relatively easy thing to prepare&#x2014;season it, slap it into a hot pan, don&#x2019;t overcook&#x2014;but while talking to meat aficionados, I quickly learned about the skill and patience required for a superior version of the dish. When I arrived in Paris, a food-loving American friend sent me to the southern edge of the city to the fourteenth ar�rondissement, to visit William Bernet at Le Severo. Who better could explain the intricacies of a hunk of beef and a few fried potatoes?<br><br>Bernet is a thickset man with the observant eyes of an experi�enced waiter and professorial-style glasses that slide down his nose. He grew up in the Vosges, in northeastern France, where he trained as a butcher, eventually moving to Paris and working, among other places, at the famed Boucheries Nivernaises. In 2005 he opened Le Severo, a shoe box of a restaurant with a handful of dark wooden tables, a series of scrawled chalkboard menus covering the room&#x2019;s longest wall, and a short zinc bar overlooking a kitchen big enough for one. Bernet fulfilled front-of-the-house duties&#x2014;taking orders, delivering food, and recommending wine from the two hundred bottles on offer&#x2014;while the cook presided over this tiny kitchen. I heard the fresh sizzle of meat hitting a hot saucepan, the crack and bubble of freshly cut Bintje potatoes twice bathed in hot oil, first an initial dip of 140�F and then a second one at 350�F.<br><br>Steak&#x2019;s true magic, Bernet explained, happens before the meat ever hits the heat&#x2014;it&#x2019;s found in the aging process. He hangs whole cuts of well-marbled beef in a dry, chilled space for weeks, some�times months, a process that concentrates the meat&#x2019;s flavor and breaks down its connective tissues, resulting in richly beefy, butter-tender fillets. In French, dry-aged meat is called <i>rassis,</i> a term that can also refer to stale bread or to a stick-in-the-mud.<br><br>Aside from a few first-course salads; side dishes of green beans, fries, or potato puree; and classic desserts like cr�me br�l�e, I spot�ted only meat on the menu: beef or veal, served plain, without sauce. That&#x2019;s it. &#x201c;If you write about my restaurant,&#x201d; Bernet said to me with a pleading note in his voice, &#x201c;please say that I would prefer it if veg�etarians came here as little as possible. I just don&#x2019;t have anything to offer them.&#x201d;<br><br>One flight down from the dining room was Bernet&#x2019;s lair, a tiny, brightly lit basement workshop where he butchered sides of beef into individual portions like the bavette (skirt steak), faux-filet (strip steak), or entrec�te (rib eye). In a corner of the room was a walk-in refrigerator, cooled to 35�F, where he hung his oversize cuts to dry and age. Inside, the racks of meat gleamed dully, like unpolished jewels, ruby red against a startlingly white layer of fat. Bernet held up two pieces of beef, one aged, one not. &#x201c;Before it&#x2019;s <i>rassis</i> it still smells like the slaughterhouse,&#x201d; he said. I dutifully sniffed both pieces. They smelled exactly the same to me&#x2014;a faint, raw, damp whiff of aging animal. Some of the older pieces of beef had devel�oped a dark, furry mold on their surface, a crust that Bernet would trim off when portioning the meat for service. (When I asked if I could take a photo of the meat locker, he gave me a horrified look. &#x201c;I would never allow a picture of this to be published!&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s too unappetizing&#x2014;no one would ever come to eat in my restaurant again.&#x201d;)<br><br>Today, under the constraints of time and profit, the practice of aging beef in France is disappearing. A well-aged slice of beef has lost at least 30 percent of its original volume in evaporation&#x2014;a con�siderable amount if your product is sold by weight. It&#x2019;s next to im�possible to find a Parisian butcher or steak bistro offering<i> boeuf rassis,</i> Bernet told me. He checked the refrigerator&#x2019;s meat, rewrap�ping some pieces in muslin, turning others, handling them as if he were an artist and these hunks of flesh his oeuvres. He showed me a c�te de boeuf, a prized cut that sells in the restaurant for eighty eu�ros for two people, turning it from one side to the other. &#x201c;It takes at least thirty days&#x2014;minimum&#x2014;to age a c�te de boeuf properly,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I...</p><h2>High Five! The Magic of Working Together</h2><p><p><em>High Five! </em>combines the spellbinding charm of a timeless parable with cutting-edge information about why teams are important and what individuals and organizations can do to build successful ones.</p><p>Through the story of Alan Foster, a workplace one-man band,<em> High Five!</em> identifies the four key ingredients of winning teams. Although Alan is an effective producer, he is unwilling to share the spotlight by partnering on projects and is fired because, as his boss puts it, "Alan, we need good producers who are <em>good team players,</em> too." It is a bitter pill for him to swallow.</p><p>While mulling over his disappointment, he takes his son to his grade-five hockey practice, where it is clear that his son's team, the Riverbend Warriors, knows nothing about teamwork, either. When the team's two overworked coaches learn of Alan's plight, they persuade him to join their ranks, and he finds himself charged with teaching himself and the players the meaning of teamwork. With the help of a woman friend-a former girls' basketball coach who has "won more high school basketball championships than anyone"-Alan and the Warriors learn the magic of teamwork and that "none of us is as smart as all of us."</p><p>With its simple style and easy-to-follow techniques, <em>High Five! </em>is a must-read for anyone seeking to learn the value and power of teamwork.</p></p><p>Organizational guru Ken Blanchard has long had a knack for writing management books that are easy and fun to read (<i>The One Minute Manager</i>, plus 11 other bestsellers). Now, in his latest, he becomes (with the help of three coauthors) something of a novelist, relating the saga of the Riverbend Warriors, a come-from-behind boys' hockey team, to teach a broader lesson about the importance of, and the key dynamics behind, good teamwork in organizations of every sort.<p> <i>High Five!</i> starts with otherwise exemplary exec Alan Foster losing his job because--you guessed it--he isn't a team player. Unemployed, bored, and demoralized, he decides to coach his fifth-grade son's failing hockey team into better shape. But it's not until he enlists the help of Miss Weatherby, an aging African-American retired teacher and champion girls' basketball coach that things really start to turn around. As we follow the struggle of the increasingly well-oiled Warriors machine as they drill, strategize, and bond their way through the season, we learn some of the fundamental lessons of what makes good teams--and good team-building by coaches and managers. Among them are "repeated reward and repetition," the guiding notion that "none of us is as smart as all of us," and four key traits that shall here remain undisclosed (hint: their acronym spells PUCK).</p><p> As fiction goes, don't expect high literature here. But to its credit, the book's ending isn't 100 percent happy, either. If you worry that the aged but whip-smart Weatherby might die at the end, don't--instead, she becomes perhaps the world's first octogenarian, black female management consultant. As books on teamwork go, Blanchard's latest is on the lighter side, but it still packs a fair share of commonsense wisdom when it comes to putting together, motivating, and sustaining work teams worthy of the Stanley Cup. And it may even have inaugurated a new fiction genre: the organizational tearjerker. --<i>Timothy Murphy</i></p><p>Ken Blanchard, PhD, is one of the most influential leadership experts in the world.

Born to slaves in Davidson County, Tennessee, the newly freed Love struck out for Kansas after the war. He was fifteen and already endowed with a reckless and romantic readiness. In wide-open Dodge City he joined up with an outfit from the Texas Panhandle to begin a career riding the range and fighting Indians, outlaws, and the elements. Years later he would say, &#x201c;I had an unusually adventurous life.&#x201d;&nbsp;That was rare understatement. More characteristic was Love&#x2019;s claim: &#x201c;I carry the marks of fourteen bullet wounds on different parts of my body, most any one of which would be sufficient to kill an ordinary man, but I am not even crippled.&#x201d; In 1876 a virtuoso rodeo performance in Deadwood, Dakota Territory, won him the moniker of Deadwood Dick. He became known as DD all over the West, entering into dime novels as a mysteriously dark and heroic presence. This vivid autobiography includes encounters with Bat Masterson and Billy the Kid, a soon-after view of the Custer battlefield, and a successful courtship. Love left the range in 1890, the year of the official closing of the frontier. Then, as a Pullman train conductor he traveled his old trails, and those good times bring his story to a satisfying end.</p><p>Introducing this Bison Books edition is Brackette F.

They are honest-to-goodness gnomes, none of your baby, fairy-book tinsel stuff, and they live by hunting and fishing, like the animals and birds, which is only proper and right.&#x201d; &#x2014;From the author&#x2019;s introduction<br> &nbsp;<br> On the banks of the Folly Brook, inside an old oak tree, live the last three gnomes in Britain: Sneezewort, Baldmoney, and Dodder. Before their fourth brother, Cloudberry, disappeared upstream seeking adventure, they lived happily and peacefully among their woodland friends. But now spring has come and the brothers start thinking about spending the summer traveling upstream to find Cloudberry. Before long they&#x2019;ve built a boat and set off for unknown lands, where they find themselves involved in all kinds of adventures with new friends (wood mice, water voles, badgers) as well as with enemies (two-legged giants). A classic of British literature, BB&#x2019;s <i>The Little Grey Men</i> has much in common with Kenneth Grahame&#x2019;s <i>The Wind in the Willows</i>, though as BB acknowledges in his introduction, the talking gnomes are only part of the story. The true plot, which BB, an unparalleled naturalist, brings thrillingly to life is the magic of the woods and streams, the beauty of unspoiled nature and of the great diversity of living things.</p><p><b>BB</b> (1905&#x2013;1990) is the pseudonym for the British naturalist, illustrator, and children&#x2019;s author Denys James Watkins-Pitchford. In 1942, he won the Carnegie Medal for British children&#x2019;s books. Watkins-Pitchford was born in Lamport, Northamptonshire, where he developed a love of the great outdoors, hunting, fishing, and drawing, all of which influenced his writing. He attended the Northampton School of Art, and while there won a traveling scholarship to Paris, where he attended drawing classes and worked in a studio in Montparnasse. In 1924, he started studying at the Royal College of Art in London, and in 1930 he began working as an assistant art master at Rugby School and contributing to the <i>Shooting Times </i>as an illustrator and a writer. It was during this time that he adopted his nom de plume, BB, which was based on the size of the shot he used when hunting geese. In 1986, he was awarded an honorary MA by Leicester University and in 1990 was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire. BB followed <i>The Little Grey Men</i> with a sequel, <i>Down the Bright Stream</i>.&#x201c;I have been in love with this book since my early childhood...I hope that young people everywhere will enjoy this exquisite classic as much as I still do.&#x201d; &#x2014;Julie Andrews<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The plot, involving three gnomes who set off upstream in search of a fourth who went a-questing two years earlier, is thoroughly wrapped in rhapsodic descriptions of bird song and nodding wildflowers, bubbling waters, breezes and storms, grassy pastures, the pleasures of angling, and nature observed from ground level.... [F]ans of <i>Wind in the Willows</i> will feel right at home.... The story winds down to a happy twist at the end. Given patient listeners, this Carnegie Medal&#x2013;winner makes a leisurely but finally engaging read-aloud.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Kirkus</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Though it&#x2019;s a little galling to discover that I am not the only person who thinks that 1941&#x2019;s [Carnegie Medal] winner, <i>The Little Grey Men</i> by BB, is a terrifically moving elegy for an England now almost extinct, it is gladdening in the extreme to know that other people have also been beguiled by the beauty of a meticulously observed countryside inhabited by gnomes with a passion for pipe-smoking.&#x201d; &#x2014;Olivia Laing, &#x201c;In Praise of the Carnegie Medal,&#x201d; <i>The Guardian</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;<i>The Little Grey Men</i> established (Denys Watkins-Pitchford, A.K.A. &#x2018;B.B.&#x2019;) at the forefront of children&#x2019;s literature.&#x201d; &#x2014;CILIP Carnegie &amp; Kate Greenaway Children&#x2019;s Book Awards</p><h2>Riding Shotgun (A Red Ryan Western)</h2><p><b>JOHNSTONE COUNTRY.

Written in an easy-to-follow approach, it can be used for individual study or class-room setting to prepare the student for advanced board drafting or CAD drafting. The book stays &#39;on the subject&#39; to teach the basic principles and techniques of mechanical drawing. It introduces the instruments and explains their use before proceeding through the topics, one by one, of lettering, orthographic projection, measuring and scaling, dimensioning, sectioning, pictorial drawings, and sketching.

It was the literal engine of the Industrial Revolution, and it played an instrumental role in putting the United States on the world stage. While the steam locomotive's basic principle of operation is simple, designers and engineers honed these concepts into 100-mph passenger trains and 600-ton behemoths capable of hauling mile-long freight at incredible speeds. <i>American Steam Locomotives </i>is a thorough and engaging history of the invention that captured public imagination like no other, and the people who brought it to life.</p><p></p></p><p><p></p><p>William L. Withuhn (1941&#x2013;2017) was the long-time transportation curator at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History. He was a licensed locomotive engineer who ran dozens of steam engines, from saddle-tankers to Northerns. Withuhn was also the chairman of the Federal Railroad Administration's Engineering Standards Committee, which re-wrote regulations for the 21st century and thus helped ensure continued operation of heritage locomotives.

Essential Skills for Scale Modelers, written by FineScale Modeler&#39;s Aaron Skinner, lays the foundation needed to build, paint, weather, and display all types of models. This technique-driven how-to book contains a variety of projects that allow modelers to put their new found skills to use.</p><p>Aaron Skinner built his first model, some kind of racecar in white plastic, when he was 5, and has had at least one model under construction ever since.

Epicurus &#x2014; who was born at Samos, Greece, in 341 BC&nbsp;and died at Athens in 270 BC &#x2014; founded a school of philosophy that focused on maximizing simple pleasures and minimizing pain, such as the irrational fear of death. "Death is nothing to us," declared Epicurus, "since when we are, death has not come, and when death has come, we are not."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The philosopher did not believe that humans would be punished for their sins after death, and he stressed the lifelong search for lasting pleasures: tranquility, friendship, and&nbsp;philosophical inquiry.&nbsp; Although Epicurus was a prolific author, very few of his writings have survived. This volume, edited and translated by George K. Strodach,&nbsp;features three important letters and a collection of observations preserved by the biographer of ancient philosophers, Diogenes Laertius. Students of philosophy and ancient history will appreciate this compilation of Epicurus's enduring wisdom.</p><p>Greek philosopher Epicurus (341&#x2013;270 BC) founded a school in Athens that focused on the art of living.

These tales described how the gods created the earth and its life, how the stars were created, and why the days are longer in summer.

She retells them with the true flavor and simplicity of the storytellers of long ago.

Conyers lives in Massachusetts, where she teaches in a community college.<b>Introduction</b><br><br>Loneliness. Fear. Self-doubt. Self-criticism. These feelings lie at the heart of the shadowy inner world of many women today--even women who seem to have it all. Regardless of how successful we may appear to others or how much we've accomplished in our lives, we're often our most determined detractor, our most unforgiving critic.<br><br>We might catch a glimpse of ourselves in a mirror and think, "I look old and tired. I look fat." Or we lose a job through no fault of our own and tell ourselves, "I'm a failure. I can't do anything right." Perhaps our marriage ends or we yell at our children and we conclude, "I'm a terrible person. I don't deserve to be loved."<br><br>For women in recovery from addictions to alcohol, drugs, food, and compulsive behaviors, this painful self-criticism goes even deeper. Our life experiences have led us to question our own value, to deny our fundamental worth as a human being. Many of us were subjected to some sort of trauma at a critical point in our development, often at the hands of someone we trusted. Trauma damages our core sense of self and fills us with shame.<br><br>Our addictions inflicted new traumas: fractured relationships, public and private humiliations, and lost opportunities. On top of all that, we bear the stigma of being a woman with addictions.<br><br>All addictions carry some degree of stigma, whether the addict is male or female. But a greater stigma is attached to women. According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, there are about 18 million alcoholics or problem drinkers in the United States. By some estimates, about a third of them are women. Yet Al-Anon membership is overwhelmingly female. (Al-Anon is a mutual support group for friends and families of problem drinkers.) Shame surely plays a role in men's reluctance to publicly acknowledge and seek help for the problem of an alcoholic partner.<br><br>We can also see the stigma of female addiction in the public's response to celebrities with substance abuse problems. Consider the well-publicized struggles of actors Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan. Many people seemed to regard Sheen's antics as nothing worse than the hijinks of a notorious "bad boy." Lohan, on the other hand, garnered widespread ridicule for her many failed attempts to get clean.<br><br>As one alcoholism counselor put it, "A man who falls down drunk is still a man, but a woman who falls down drunk is a tramp." The double standard was also observed by the late Carolyn Knapp, who wrote in her memoir <i>Drinking: A Love Story,</i> "A messy drunk's an ugly thing, especially when it's a woman."<br><br>For women with addictions, the stigma becomes part of our self-identity, further damaging our already shaky emotional inner world. Our fear and our pain and our shame saturate the very core of our being, shaping our decisions, coloring our relationships, and defining who we think we are--sometimes even after years of living clean and sober. But that's hardly surprising, especially when we think about women in recovery within the broader context of womanhood today. "Traditional" and "modern" interpretations of femininity have been at odds for generations. In the mid-1800s, women's rights activist Susan B. Anthony wrote, "Modern invention has banished the spinning wheel, and the same law of progress makes the woman of today a different woman from her grandmother." A century later, First Lady Bess Truman observed, "A woman's place in public is to sit beside her husband, be silent, and be sure her hat is on straight."<br><br>Since then, the emergence of feminism and the entry of millions of women into the workforce have given us a sense of empowerment that our grandmothers probably never had. Still, like generations of women before us, we are bombarded with confusing and contradictory messages about our value to society. It can sometimes feel as though womanhood itself is under attack.<br><br>On one hand, we are expected to be nurturing, pleasant, and wholesome (hence the stigma for female addicts). On the other hand, pornography permeates our culture and degrades the value of women. We are expected to be chaste and at the same time sexually proficient. We are told it's our minds, not our bodies, that matter, yet we are judged by our physical attractiveness. We are taught that we are men's equal, yet violence against women remains an ugly fact of life for millions of us. We are the breadwinner or partial breadwinner in our families, but women still are not equally compensated for doing the same work as men. Arguably, our central role in mainstream society remains that of homemaker and mother.<br><br>In this minefield of conflicting messages, is it any wonder why so many women struggle to develop a healthy sense of their own worth? For women in recovery, who have spent years numbing and running away from difficult emotions, the task is even harder. We have used alcohol, drugs, food, shopping, sex, codependence, and other substances and behaviors to avoid and distract ourselves from the wounds at our core. We have little or no practice with confronting painful feelings in ways that contribute to our personal growth.<br><br>Our early days of recovery provided yet another avenue of escape from upsetting emotions. We were physically and mentally stressed, and we focused all our energy on staying clean and sober, one day at a time. And rightly so. Abstinence is the goal of early recovery. Little else can be achieved without it.<br><br>But as time passes and we become more secure in our recovery, long-buried feelings inevitably emerge. Wounds from the past are still deep inside us, unexamined, untended, and unhealed. The harm we have done to ourselves and to others is waiting to be acknowledged, understood, and mended.<br><br>At this point some of us are tempted to relapse, to retreat to the familiar numbing comfort of substances or compulsive behaviors. This is understandable. Nothing has prepared us for the difficulty of confronting painful memories head-on. We never learned how to face the source of our anger and grief and remorse or to fully feel our emotions. We are frightened by what has hurt us in the past and uncertain of our ability to cope with it.<br><br>Yet personal growth requires us to stop running and start engaging in the process of facing our emotions--not so we can wallow in pain or relive the trauma, but so we can move beyond it and become our healthy, authentic self.<br><br>Most of our ideas about who we are--whether we call ourselves good or bad, strong or weak, worthy or unworthy--come from our <i>feelings</i> about ourselves. These feelings, which begin in infancy and develop throughout our lives, determine our understanding of who we are. And who we think we are--<i>how we see ourselves</i>--influences every choice we make, from our choice of education and career to our decisions about relationships and self-care.<br><br>That's why emotional healing is so powerful. Personal growth cannot happen without it. Until we untangle the web of hurtful and damaging emotions that prevent us from seeing ourselves clearly, we will continue to suffer from our secret belief that something is wrong with us. And that belief will prevent us from achieving our full potential or recognizing our true value as a unique, worthwhile person.<br><br>The Twelve Steps are not only a path to freedom from our addictions, they also offer guideposts to emotional healing, gently leading us to higher levels of understanding and self-awareness. Professional therapists also offer support and guidance. Good therapists let us explore our emotions at our own pace and in our own way, understanding that emotional healing cannot be rushed. It unfolds differently for every woman.<br><br>This book is offered as a companion for your journey, not to provide answers--those you will discover for yourself--but to suggest avenues of exploration and to share the experiences of others on the same path. At the end of each chapter you'll find several journal questions. These are meant to stimulate ideas to write about or discuss with a trusted mentor or therapist. Use them only to the extent that you find them helpful.<br><br>Ultimately, the journey of emotional healing is deeply personal--and it is the work of a lifetime. Our search for our own truths and our own meaning, once begun, never really ends, because the accumulation of experience and knowledge cannot help but affect our understanding of ourselves and others. The way we think about something at the age of thirty is likely to be different by the time we reach sixty.<br><br>Nevertheless, as we acknowledge, examine, and come to terms with the feelings we have tried so hard to run away from, we can begin to free ourselves of old, negative misperceptions about ourselves. We start to see ourselves more clearly and to recognize our own strengths, values, and virtues.<br><br>As our wounded heart begins to heal, we take our first small, courageous, wonderfully liberating steps towards self-acceptance, personal fulfillment, and spiritual wholeness.<br></p><h2>This Chair Rocks: A Manifesto Against Ageism</h2><p><p><b>Author, activist, and TED speaker Ashton Applewhite has written a rousing manifesto calling for an end to discrimination and prejudice on the basis of age.</b></p><p>In our youth obsessed culture, we&#x2019;re bombarded by media images and messages about the despairs and declines of our later years. Beauty and pharmaceutical companies work overtime to convince people to purchase products that will retain their youthful appearance and vitality. Wrinkles are embarrassing. Gray hair should be colored and bald heads covered with implants. Older minds and bodies are too frail to keep up with the pace of the modern working world and olders should just step aside for the new generation. </p><p>Ashton Applewhite once held these beliefs too until she realized where this prejudice comes from and the damage it does. Lively, funny, and deeply researched, <i>This Chair Rocks</i> traces her journey from apprehensive boomer to pro-aging radical, and in the process debunks myth after myth about late life. Explaining the roots of ageism in history and how it divides and debases, Applewhite examines how ageist stereotypes cripple the way our brains and bodies function, looks at ageism in the workplace and the bedroom, exposes the cost of the all-American myth of independence, critiques the portrayal of elders as burdens to society, describes what an all-age-friendly world would look like, and offers a rousing call to action. </p><p>It&#x2019;s time to create a world of age equality by making discrimination on the basis of age as unacceptable as any other kind of bias.

This kind of bird could blind a man or, at the least, rip his face to shreds.<br><br>Logan stood dead still, maintaining his position as he continued to return the bird's cold, speculative stare. There seemed to be something in its eyes. Something that might exist in the eyes of the most brutal general, the most ruthless ruler. <em>Touch my kill, and you die!</em> the bird seemed to warn.<br><br>Logan didn't back away; he didn't move at all.<br><br>He knew birds, as he knew the temperament of most animals. If he ran away, the bird would think he should be attacked, just to make sure he did get away from the kill. Come forward and, of course, the bird would fight to protect it. He had to stay still, calm, assured, and not give ground. The falcon would respect that stance, take its prey and leave.<br><br>But the bird didn't leave. It watched Logan for another minute, then cast its head back and let out a shrieking cry. It took a step toward him.<br><br>Even feeling intimidated, Logan decided his best move was <em>not</em> to move...<br><br>"I have no fight with you, brother," he said quietly.<br><br>The bird let out another cry. It hopped back to the pigeon, looked at Logan and willfully ripped the second wing off, then spat it out and stared at Logan again.<br><br>This was ridiculous, he thought. He'd never seen a peregrine falcon so much as land in his driveway, much less pick a fight with him.<br><br>He reached with slow, nonthreatening movements for his gun belt and the Colt .45 holstered there; he had no desire to harm any creature, but neither would he be blinded by a bird that seemed to be harboring an overabundance of testosterone.<br><br>As if the bird had known what the gun was, it leaped back.<br><br>Logan had the gun aimed. "I don't want to hurt you, brother bird," he said. "But if you force my hand, I will."<br><br>The bird seemed to understand him&#x2014;and to know he meant his words. It gave yet another raucous cry, jumped on the pigeon and soared into flight, taking its prey. Logan watched as the bird disappeared into the western sky.<br><br>Curious about the encounter and very surprised by it, he shook his head and turned toward his car again.<br><br>He took one step and paused, frowning.<br><br>It suddenly looked as if he'd stepped into an Alfred Hitchcock movie.<br><br><em>The Birds.</em><br><br>They were everywhere. They covered the eaves of his house, the trees and the ground, everything around him. They sat on the hood and the roof of his car. Every bird native to the state of Texas seemed to be there, all of them just staring at him. Jays, doves, grackles, blackbirds, crows and even seabirds&#x2014;a pelican stood in the center of his lawn.<br><br><em>It was bizarre. He was being watched...stalked...by birds!</em><br><br>None made a move toward him.<br><br>As he started to walk, a sparrow flapped its wings, moving aside. He continued to his car, wings fluttering around him as the smaller birds made way. When he reached his car door, he opened it slowly, carefully, and then sat behind the wheel, closing the door. He revved the engine and heard scratching noises as the birds atop his car took flight.<br><br>Logan eased out of the driveway. As he did so, a whir of black rose with a furious flapping of wings. He blinked, and when he opened his eyes again, they were gone.<br><br>Every last bird was gone.<br><br>He looked back at his old mission-style house, wondering if he'd somehow blacked out, had a vision, and yet managed to get into his car. But that was not the case. He didn't black out. For him, visions were dreams. They occurred only when he slept, and he usually laughed them away. His father's people believed that all dreams were omens, while his mother's father&#x2014;psychiatrist and philosopher William Douglas&#x2014;believed that dreams or "visions" were arguments within the human psyche. In William's view, fears and anxiety created alternate worlds seen only in the mind; their role was to help resolve emotional conflicts.<br><br>Whichever approach was correct didn't matter much. He'd seen what he had seen. This hadn't been a vision or a dream.<br><br>But it was odd that it had happened when he was on his way to meet with Jackson Crow, FBI agent and head of the mysterious Krewe of Hunters&#x2014;a unit both infamous and renowned.<br><br>San Antonio. It was different, that was all. <em>Different.</em> Kelsey O'Brien looked out the Longhorn Inn's kitchen window. From here, she could see the walls of the old chapel at the Alamo. The city was bustling, pleasantly warm now that it was spring, and the people she'd met so far were friendly and welcoming.<br><br>She still felt like a fish out of water.<br><br>That's what she was missing&#x2014;the water.<br><br>She'd been in San Antonio almost three days and they'd been nice days. San Antonio was a beautiful city. Kelsey actually had a cousin living here, Sean Cameron, but he worked for a special-effects company, and they were currently out in the desert somewhere, trying to reproduce the Alamo as it had once been for a documentary. She was grateful that her old camp friend, Sandy Holly, had bought the historic inn and one-time saloon where she was staying. Sandy made her feel a bit less like a fish out of water, but it was strange not to be within steps of both the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. Her life&#x2014;except for summer camp and college upstate&#x2014;had been spent in the Florida Keys. Where there was water. Lots and lots of water. Of course, they had the river here, and she loved the Riverwalk area, with its interesting places to go and dine and shop. The history of the city appealed to her, too.<br><br>It was just.. different. And it was going to take some getting used to. Of course, she still had no idea what she was doing here, or if she was going to stay. She might not be in San Antonio long; on the other hand, she could be transferring here. And she might be taking on a different job.<br><br>She was a United States Marshal, which meant she worked for a service that might require her to go anywhere. She'd certainly traveled in her life, but the concept that she could be moving here, making a life here, seemed unlikely&#x2014;not something she would have chosen. Now that it might be happening, she had to remind herself that she'd always known she could be transferred. But her training had been in Miami, and because of her familiarity with Key West, where she had grown up, she'd been assigned, as one of only two Marshals, to the office there. She'd been doing the job for two years now, enjoying an easy camaraderie with Trent Fisher, her coworker. They reported in to the Miami office when required, and occasionally their Miami supervisor came down. Key West was small, and despite the friction that could exist between law enforcement agencies, she'd quickly established excellent working relations with the police and the Coast Guard and the other state and federal agencies with which the two Marshals worked. And then...<br><br>Then she'd suddenly ended up here. She was still wondering why, because Archie Lawrence, her supervisor, had been so vague.<br><br>"You're going to love the situation," Archie had assured her. "You go to this meeting, and then you'll have a two-week hiatus to decide what you feel about an offer you're going to receive. So, nothing is definite yet."<br><br>"I'm being given a vacation so I can get an offer and think about it?" That hardly seemed typical of the government. "What's the offer?" she'd demanded.<br><br>"That's what your meeting is about," he'd said.<br><br>And no amount of indignant questioning or wheedling would convince him to share the details. If he even knew them... "Look, your meeting is with an FBI agent and you may be transferring services," Archie had told her. "That's all I'm at liberty to say."<br><br>"Why?" she'd asked him. "I don't want to change agencies!"<br><br>"Hey, it's come down from the brass, kiddo, and it sounds unusual&#x2014;two federal agencies getting together on a friendly basis. Hallelujah!" Archie rolled his eyes. "No one's going to <em>force</em> you to change. You're being presented with an opportunity. You can say no. I mean it. If you don't like this offer, you have the option to pack up and come home, with no harm done to your status here. So quit asking me questions. Go away. Don't darken my door&#x2014;for the time being, anyway. You have things to do, arrangements to make." He'd sent her one of his lopsided grins. She liked Archie and considered him a great boss. He was always easygoing until he went into "situation" mode and then he could spew out orders faster and with more precision than the toughest drill sergeant.<br><br>Sometimes, of course, she wondered what Archie really thought of her. She was good at her job, although some of her methods were a bit unexpected. Luckily, a lot of criminals were still sexist. They didn't realize that a woman could and would hold them to task, shoot with uncanny aim and manage handcuffs with ease. But she'd felt Archie's eyes on her a few times when she hadn't really been able to explain the intuition that had led to her discovery of a cache of drugs, a hiding place&#x2014;or a dead body. She even wondered if he was <em>hoping</em> she'd take another position.<br><br>Today, soon, she'd attend a meeting with a man from the FBI. He had an offer for her that presumably had to do with the unique abilities she'd shown during her two years with the government, and due to the status of this particular branch of service, various government offices were cooperating. On the one hand, she felt like telling someone that if she'd wanted to work for the FBI, she would have applied to the FBI. But she was curious, and she wasn't prone to be difficult; it was just the mystery of the situation.<br><br>Law enforcement agencies were not known for their cooperation&#x2014;rather sad, really, since they were all working toward the same goal. That was one of the reasons she'd loved working in Key West; they had plenty to deal with, but they were smaller, and thus got along fairly well. Drugs were constantly out on the waterways. The Coast Guard was overworked, ditto the state police and the county police. The cops in Key West loved the Marshals. It had all been pretty good. State police, Monroe County police, the Coast Guard and the U.S. Marshal's Office, all getting along, most of them meeting for a beer here and there on Duval Street or some off-the-tourist track location. In her case, it had probably helped that she'd gone to the University of Miami and done an internship with the U.S. Marshal's Office. She'd zeroed in on her chosen profession early. And she'd expected to stay in south Florida.<br><br>To contemplate a life here, in Texas, was just...strange.<br><br>Nothing wrong with Texas, of course.<br><br>But she had it all figured out. It was the water. In San Antonio, there was no coast. There was the river, though.<br><br>She glanced at her watch. Two hours until her meeting.<br><br>When she looked out the window again, she nearly jumped. In those few seconds, a massive crow had landed on the outer sill. The damned thing seemed to be staring at her. She waved a hand at it.<br><br>The bird didn't fly away. It continued to stare.<br><br>Then it pecked the window.<br><br>She almost stepped back, then didn't. She scowled at the bird. "I'm a United States Marshal, and I will not be intimated by a bird!" she said aloud.<br><br>"What's that?"<br><br>Kelsey swung around. Sandy Holly had come breezing into the kitchen.<br><br>"You have really big, aggressive birds around here," Kelsey said.<br><br>"We do?"<br><br>"Yeah, look!"<br><br>When she turned to the window again, the crow was gone. It bothered Kelsey to realize that the bird disturbed her. Ah, well, she had discovered earlier that one of the men she'd be meeting was Agent <em>Crow.</em> Maybe that knowledge had made the bird's appearance seem like something more&#x2014;like some kind of omen, for good or.<br><br>Sandy smiled, raising her eyebrows. "Anyone would think you were trying not to like Texas," she said.<br><br>"No, no, I <em>love</em> Texas. Texas is great," Kelsey told her.<br><br>"Maybe you're just a little nervous. This is the big day, right?"<br><br>"This is it," Kelsey agreed. Sandy Holly was proving to be a true friend. Kelsey had gotten to know her almost twenty years ago, when they'd been a pair of awkward eight-year-olds at the West Texas dude ranch Kelsey's parents had been sure she'd want to attend. But she'd been terrified of horses, while Sandy was terrified of being alone. Sandy had ridden before, even at five, because...because she was a Texan from San Antonio. Texans rode horses and wore big hats. So, at eight, Kelsey had toughened up enough to tell Sandy she didn't need to be homesick, and Sandy had promised Kelsey she'd learn to love horses. She did, Kelsey mused. Thanks to Sandy, she'd become an excellent rider. And, thanks to Sandy, she'd known where she wanted to stay when she came to San Antonio. The Longhorn Inn and Saloon.<br><br>It wasn't as if they'd seen each other frequently. After a few years, they had skipped camps of any kind. But they'd met with other friends in Vegas to celebrate their respective twenty-first birthdays and kept up with each other through Facebook and email. When she'd first talked about applying to be a U.S. Marshal, Sandy had encouraged her.<br><br>Kelsey was particularly glad to be here because Sandy wasn't in great shape at the moment&#x2014;taking over the old inn had proven to be a monumental task, and there were problems Sandy had hinted about that Kelsey didn't entirely understand. They hadn't really had a chance to sit down and talk, since Sandy was running a business, which meant her time was limited. It was even more limited because she'd lost a manager the week before&#x2014;the young man simply hadn't shown up for work&#x2014;and while Sandy had a great housekeeping staff of three, the organizational and hostessing duties had all fallen to her. Of course, as Kelsey well knew, Sandy could be high-strung, and she wondered if working for her friend wasn't a little stressful. On the plus side, Sandy did like to hire college guys who needed a break on a resume. None of them seemed to last too long, however.<br><br></p><h2>Battle Bunny</h2><p>When Alex gets a silly, sappy picture book called <i>Birthday Bunny</i>, he picks up a pencil and turns it into something he'd like to read: <i>Battle Bunny</i>.

Now he paints and illustrates in North Carolina.*Starred Review* This deliciously subversive piece of metafiction skewers&#x2014;with a sharp wit and a sharper pencil&#x2014;the earnest, purposeful literature so popular in the middle of the last century. The fun begins with a facsimile of something akin to an antique Little Golden Book, Birthday Bunny, complete with worn cover, yellowed pages, and wholesome message. But the book has been &#x201c;improved&#x201d; in story and pictures by a child named Alex wielding his trusty no. 2. The cover, retitled Battle Bunny, now features rockets, planes, bombs, and a general promise of mayhem. And Alex keeps that promise, transforming the insipid story of a sad bunny being cheered by his friends on his birthday into a raucous adventure wherein an evil bunny unleashes a tornado of destruction on the unsuspecting forest until the president is forced to call in one Agent Alex to save the day. Alex&#x2019;s &#x201c;edits,&#x201d; including a complete reworking of the text and plenty of pictorial embellishments, are soaked in testosterone. The animals of the forest become luchadores and ninja warriors; Air Force One and a few presidents (Obama and Lincoln) make appearances; and just about everything explodes. In the end, Alex is victorious, Battle Bunny is vanquished, and the world is safe. At least until Alex and his pencil ride again . . .

Born in Chile, she would grow to become the first Nobel Prize-winning Latina woman in the world. As a poet and a teacher, she inspired children across many countries to let their voices be heard. This beautifully crafted story, where words literally come to life, is told with the rhythm and melody of a poem. The second in Luna Rising&#39;s bilingual storybook biography series. My Name is Gabriela/Me llamo Gabriela is beautiful tribute to a woman who taught us the power of words and the importance of following our dreams. The story of Gabriela Mistral will continue to inspire children everywhere.</p><p><i>Starred Review.</i> Kindergarten-Grade 2&#x2013;This lyrical homage to the Chilean Nobel Prize winner is a joy to read. Written in the first person, the simple text follows the life of the poet from her earliest days (in which, as a girl, she chooses her own name and teaches herself to read) to her internationally renowned career in literature. Brown and the unnamed translator have created a poignantly poetic text that reads equally well in English and in Spanish. It depicts, above all else, the poets lifelong love affair with words and stories. Parras naive-style illustrations, which appear to be painted on wood, go well beyond complementing the text. They offer a view into a softly colored world of people, places, and creatures, real or imagined, that were described in Mistrals work. An exquisite addition for most collections. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The first work of its kind to reflect significant advances in linguistics made in recent decades, it provides students, teachers and academics with a comprehensive yet user-friendly treatment. The chapters on phonology and morphology make full use of insights from comparative and historical linguistics to elucidate complex systems of roots, stems and endings. The syntax offers linguistically up-to-date descriptions of such topics as case usage, tense and aspect, voice, subordinate clauses, infinitives and participles. An innovative section on textual coherence treats particles and word order and discusses several sample passages in detail, demonstrating new ways of approaching Greek texts. Throughout the book numerous original examples are provided, all with translations and often with clarifying notes. Clearly laid-out tables, helpful cross-references and full indexes make this essential resource accessible to users of all levels.</p><p>This entirely new, comprehensive reference grammar of Classical Greek is aimed at students, teachers and academics.

Check out his work at timjessell.com.If someone had told me that one day I&#x2019;d be keeping a diary, I would have said, &#x201c;Old boy, you must be stark-staring mad. Me? The canine companion of glamorous globe-trotters Mr. Henry Sleeper Harper and his charming wife, Myra? Do I look like some sort of owlish scribbler?&#x201d; I have always said leave the diary keeping to those ambitious, brainy types, like border collies and pinschers. We Pekingese are meant for finer things. No inky paws for me, thank you very much. <br> But that was <i>before</i> I set sail on the RMS <i>Titanic</i>, the newest, sleekest, most deluxe ship in the White Star Line fleet. On its historic maiden voyage, it was to carry us far across the ocean, from Europe to our home in New York City, in seven short days. As it turned out, that voyage gave me something to write about. More, in fact, than I could ever have imagined. <br> Simply <i>everyone</i> who was <i>anyone</i> was aboard. The cream of canine society. Heading up the list was the Airedale companion of the fabulously wealthy John Jacob Astor. The beloved chow chow of stockbroker Harry Anderson also had a ticket. Then there was the prize French bulldog purchased in England by banker Robert Daniel for what I hear was an indecently high price. And who could forget little Frou-Frou, that foolish little bit of fluff? I could go on, but you&#x2019;ll meet them all soon enough, all ten of them. Eleven, including yours truly. Eleven lucky dogs&#x2014;or so we thought at the time. And let us not forget those humans aboard <i>without</i> dogs&#x2014;poor lonesome souls! They just happened to number among the wealthiest humans alive, including the silver-mine queen of Colorado, Margaret Brown, and businessman Benjamin Guggenheim, a friend of the ship&#x2019;s captain. And have I mentioned Lady Duff-Gordon and Lady Rothes? Why, there were so many wealthy people on board, they called it &#x201c;the Millionaires&#x2019; Special.&#x201d; Sadly, as it turned out, there are some things even money cannot buy. <br> <i>Titanic</i>. There was such a bold ring to the name. Just hearing it gave me the tingles as I sat on the train that took us from Paris to the dock at Cherbourg, France. Myra was busy doing this and that with Henry, so I sat in the lap of our man, Hammad Hassat. <br> Hammad had joined our happy crew on a recent tour of Egypt. He was the Harpers&#x2019; interpreter and guide to the wonders of that ancient land. Don&#x2019;t ask me what he was still doing with us (not that I minded one jot). Henry thought it would be a lark to bring Hammad back to America with us. And who, one must wonder, could possibly have need of an Egyptian interpreter in New York City? I suspect Henry wanted to be the first in his set to boast of an Egyptian manservant. That was Henry. Such a wag. (You should excuse the expression.) <br> Hammad was frightfully mysterious and dashingly handsome. Everywhere we went, people stared at him. But Hammad cast his eyes downward. I think he felt like an outsider. He was also sad. And who could blame the poor dear chap? He missed his family in Cairo. I was perhaps his only friend. Wasn&#x2019;t he the lucky one? <br> Hammad, unlike me, was <i>not</i> looking forward to the voyage. The only body of water he had ever crossed before embarking on this trip was the river Nile. He was jittery on the boat from Egypt to Marseille. And the Mediterranean is a mere pond compared to the vast Atlantic Ocean. <br> In Paris, Hammad sent a marconigram to his brother, Said, in Cairo. He wanted to share with him the news of our upcoming voyage. (Marconigrams were the newfangled way humans sent messages to one another over long distances via a clever sort of wire.) Hammad&#x2019;s brother wired back to say that he foresaw the future. And what did he see? Death and destruction on the high seas. Can you imagine such a thing? <br> If Hammad was a Gloomy Gus, I was a ray of sunshine. At least I tried. (They don&#x2019;t call me Sunny for nothing!) <i>Old man, this voyage is going to be duck soup&#x2014;you&#x2019;ll see</i>, I told Hammad. <i>Strictly smooth sailing!</i> <br> I said this not in so many words, of course. We Pekes aren&#x2019;t much for barking. (And yapping isn&#x2019;t really my style.) But we do have the most expressive eyes. Some say we are &#x201c;all eyes.&#x201d; <br> Hammad knew and spoke many languages&#x2014; including the one my eyes spoke. He understood me well. And I was equally good at reading his brooding silences. But for all my efforts to cheer him, Hammad could not shake his air of gloom and doom. Now I know why. But then I thought he was just being moody. <br> We arrived at the dock to find a large crowd of fellow travelers and well-wishers. But where was the <i>Titanic</i>? A couple of tenders bobbed against the pilings: the SS <i>Traffic</i> and the SS <i>Nomadic</i>. (Don&#x2019;t ask me why, but humans just love to name things. Their ships, their houses, their racehorses, even their dogs&#x2014;rather poorly, I might add.) <br> <i>Cheer up, old chap</i>, my eyes told Hammad. <i>Our trusty pals here,</i> Traffic <i>and </i>Nomadic, <i>are here to take us to the </i>Titanic, <i>no doubt.</i> <br> Hammad heaved a dispirited sigh. I could tell that he wished the <i>Titanic</i> had sailed without us. <br> While mates and servants piled mountains of luggage into the tenders, first-class passengers were ever so huffy. Why was there no grand ship here to meet them? <br> &#x201c;Say, old man,&#x201d; Henry asked the mate assisting us in boarding the <i>Traffic</i>, &#x201c;where is the <i>Titanic</i>?&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Not to worry, sir,&#x201d; said the mate. &#x201c;It left Southampton exactly at noon.

The bad news is that planets fit to live on are scarce&#x2015;and alien races willing to fight us for them are common. So: we fight.

The bulk of humanity's resources are in the hands of the Colonial Defense Force. Everybody knows that when you reach retirement age, you can join the CDF. They don't want young people; they want people who carry the knowledge and skills of decades of living. You'll be taken off Earth and never allowed to return. You'll serve two years at the front. And if you survive, you'll be given a generous homestead stake of your own, on one of our hard-won colony planets.</p><p>John Perry is taking that deal. He has only the vaguest idea what to expect.

He is convincing in his application of classic socialist theory to current economic situations and modern political systems, and he examines the validity of the idea of &#x201c;visionary gradualism&#x201d; in bringing about a socialist agenda. He believes that if freedom and justice are to survive into the next century, the socialist movement will be a critical factor. This is the definitive text on the role of socialism throughout history which <i>Publishers Weekly</i> calls &#x201c;succinct, readable&#x201d; and the <i>Los Angeles Times Book Review&nbsp;</i>says is &#x201c;magnificent . . . more than anything, this is a book about hope.&#x201d;<br><br>In this passionate book, the late Michael Harrington draws on a lifetime of thinking and politicking to reject much that has passed for socialism and to define the new forms that will make it the only &#x201c;hope for human freedom and justice&#x201d; (<i>Foreign Affairs</i>) in the twenty-first century.</p><p><b>Michael Harrington</b>&nbsp;was an American democratic socialist, bestselling writer, political activist, professor of political science, NPR commentator, atheist, and founder of the Democratic Socialists of America.

The new socialism, he says, has to be truly international (unlike most socialism in past practice) and must be democratic in more than a political sense, providing real participation in economic decisions.

December is the time of the annual Ceremony at which each twelve year old receives a life assignment from the Elders. Jonas's friend Fiona is named Caretaker of the Old. His cheerful pal Asher becomes the Assistant Director of Recreation. But Jonas has been chosen for something special. When his selection leads him to an unnamed man known only as the Giver, Jonas begins to sense the dark secrets that underlie the fragile perfection of his world.</p></p><p>In a world with no poverty, no crime, no sickness and no unemployment, and where every family is happy, 12-year-old Jonas is chosen to be the community's Receiver of Memories. Under the tutelage of the Elders and an old man known as the Giver, he discovers the disturbing truth about his utopian world and struggles against the weight of its hypocrisy. With echoes of <i>Brave New World</i>, in this 1994 Newbery Medal winner, Lowry examines the idea that people might freely choose to give up their humanity in order to create a more stable society. Gradually Jonas learns just how costly this ordered and pain-free society can be, and boldly decides he cannot pay the price.here audio again</p><h2>Have His Carcase (Lord Peter Wimsey)</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;Written with distinction and wit, and is as much as psychological story as an experiment in detection. It has all the excitement which a detective story should offer.&#x201d; &#x2014;&nbsp;<em>The Spectator</em></strong></p><p>The great Dorothy L. Sayers is considered by many to be the premier detective novelist of the Golden Age, and her dashing sleuth, Lord Peter Wimsey, one of mystery fiction&#x2019;s most enduring and endearing protagonists. Acclaimed author Ruth Rendell has expressed her admiration for Sayers&#x2019;s work, praising her &#x201c;great fertility of invention, ingenuity, and wonderful eye for detail.&#x201d; The second Dorothy L. Sayers classic to feature mystery writer Harriet Vane, <em>Have His Carcase</em> features an introduction by Elizabeth George, herself a crime fiction master. Harriet&#x2019;s discovery of a murdered body on the beach before it is swept out to sea unites her once more with the indomitable Lord Peter, as together they attempt to solve a most lethal mystery, and find themselves become much closer than mere sleuthing partners in the process. <br></p></p><p><p>Mystery novelist Harriet Vane, recovering from an unhappy love affair and its most unpleasant aftermath, seeks solace on a barren beach deserted but for one notable exception: the body of a bearded young man with his throat cut. From the moment she photographs the corpse, which soon disappears with the tide, she is puzzled by a mystery that might easily have been a suicide, a murder, or a political plot. With the appearance of her dear friend Lord Peter Wimsey, however, Harriet finds yet another reason to pursue the mystery, as only the two of them can pursue it.</p><p>Dorothy L. Sayers was born in 1893. She was one of the first women to be awarded a degree by Oxford University, and later she became a copywriter at an ad agency. In 1923 she published her first novel featuring the aristocratic detective Lord Peter Wimsey, who became one of the world's most popular fictional heroes.

The term &#x201c;indigenous storywork&#x201d; has come to encompass the sheer breadth of ways in which indigenous storytelling serves as a historical record, as a form of teaching and learning, and as an expression of indigenous culture and identity. But such traditions have too often been relegated to the realm of myth and legend, recorded as fragmented distortions, or erased altogether.<br><br><i>Decolonizing Research</i> brings together indigenous researchers and activists from Canada, Australia, and New Zealand to assert the unique value of indigenous storywork as a focus of research, and to develop methodologies that rectify the colonial attitudes inherent in much past and current scholarship. By bringing together their own indigenous perspectives, and by treating indigenous storywork on its own terms, the contributors illuminate valuable new avenues for research, and show how such reworked scholarship can contribute to the movement for indigenous rights and self-determination.</p><p><b>Jo-ann Archibald</b> (Q&#x2019;um Q&#x2019;um Xiiem) is a scholar and educational practitioner from the Sto:lo and St&#x2019;at&#x2019;imc First Nations in British Columbia, Canada.

He was, says author Barry Strauss, the last casualty of one civil war and the first casualty of the next civil war, which would end the Roman Republic and inaugurate the Roman Empire. &#x201c;<i>The Death of Caesar</i> provides a fresh look at a well-trodden event, with superb storytelling sure to inspire awe&#x201d; (<i>The Philadelphia Inquirer</i>).<br> <br>Why was Caesar killed? For political reasons, mainly. The conspirators wanted to return Rome to the days when the Senate ruled, but Caesar hoped to pass along his new powers to his family, especially Octavian. The principal plotters were Brutus, Cassius (both former allies of Pompey), and Decimus. The last was a leading general and close friend of Caesar&#x2019;s who felt betrayed by the great man: He was the mole in Caesar&#x2019;s camp. But after the assassination everything went wrong. The killers left the body in the Senate and Caesar&#x2019;s allies held a public funeral. Mark Antony made a brilliant speech&#x2014;not &#x201c;Friends, Romans, Countrymen&#x201d; as Shakespeare had it, but something inflammatory that caused a riot. The conspirators fled Rome.

Visit BarryStrauss.com.Death of Caesar 1<p></p> RIDING WITH CAESAR<p></p> <br>IN AUGUST 45 B.C., SEVEN months before the Ides of March, a procession entered the city of Mediolanum, modern Milan, in the hot and steamy northern Italian plain. Two chariots led the march. In the first stood Dictator Gaius Julius Caesar, glowing with his victory over rebel forces in Hispania (Spain).<br> <br>In the position of honor beside Caesar was Marcus Antonius&#x2014;better known today as Mark Antony. He was Caesar&#x2019;s candidate to be one of Rome&#x2019;s two consuls next year, the highest-ranking public officials after the dictator. Behind them came Caesar&#x2019;s prot�g�, Decimus, fresh from a term as governor of Gaul (roughly, France). Beside him was Gaius Octavius, better known as Octavian. At the age of only seventeen, Caesar&#x2019;s grandnephew Octavian was already a man to be reckoned with.<br> <br>The four men had met in southern Gaul and traveled together over the Alps. They took the Via Domitia, an old road full of doom and destiny&#x2014;Hannibal&#x2019;s invasion route and, according to myth, Hercules&#x2019; road to Spain.<br> <br>Caesar was heading for Rome. For the second time in little over a year, he was planning to enter the capital in triumph, proclaiming military victory and an end to the civil war that began four years earlier, at the start of 49 B.C. But it was not easy to end the war, because its roots went deep. It was in fact the second civil war to tear Rome apart in Caesar&#x2019;s lifetime. Each war reflected the overwhelming problems that beset Rome, from poverty in Italy to oppression in the provinces, from the purblind selfishness and reactionary politics of the old nobility to the appeal of a charismatic dictator for getting things done. And behind it all lay the dawning and uncomfortable reality that the real power in Rome lay not with the Senate or the people but with the army.<br> <br>Dark-eyed and silver-tongued, sensual and violent, Caesar possessed supreme practical ability. He used it to change the world, driven by his love for Rome and his lust for domination. Caesar&#x2019;s armies killed or enslaved millions, many of them women and children. Yet after these bloodbaths he pardoned his enemies at home and abroad. These overtures of goodwill raised suspicions&#x2014;could the conqueror be a conciliator?&#x2014;but most had no choice but to acquiesce.<br> <br>Of all the Romans in his entourage, Caesar chose these three men&#x2014;Antony, Decimus, and Octavian&#x2014;for places of honor on his reentry to Italy. Why? And why would one of them betray him within seven months? And why, after Caesar&#x2019;s death, were the three men able to raise armies and turn on each other in a new war that retraced their route from northern Italy into southern Gaul?<br> <br>Consider how each of these men came to Caesar in the years before 45 B.C.<br> THE RISE OF DECIMUS<p></p> <br>Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus, to use his full name, was a close friend of Caesar. They had worked together for at least a decade, beginning in 56 B.C. In that year, when Decimus was about twenty-five years of age, he made a sensation as Caesar&#x2019;s admiral in Gaul. He won the Battle of the Atlantic, which conquered Brittany and opened the door to the invasion of England.<br> <br>First impressions are important and, in this case, accurate. War, Gaul, and Caesar were Decimus&#x2019;s trademarks. He was speedy, vigorous, resourceful, and he loved to fight. He was proud, competitive, and eager for fame. Like other ambitious men of his class, he won elected office in Rome, but the capital and its corridors of power never captivated him as the Gallic frontier did.<br> <br>Decimus was born on April 21, around 81 B.C. He came from a noble family that claimed descent from the founder of the Roman republic, Lucius Junius Brutus. Decimus&#x2019;s grandfather was a great general and statesman but his father was no soldier and his mother was a flirt who dallied with revolution and adultery and perhaps with Caesar, who seduced many of the married noble ladies in Rome. A great historian suggested that Decimus was Caesar&#x2019;s illegitimate son. Intriguing as this theory is, it is not supported by the evidence.<br> <br>In any case, young Decimus found his way to Caesar&#x2019;s staff. The military suited Decimus. By hitching his wagon to Caesar&#x2019;s bright star he restored his family&#x2019;s name for armed might. He was Caesar&#x2019;s man as much as any Roman was.<br> <br>We don&#x2019;t know what Decimus looked like. He might have been attractive like his mother, a well-known beauty, and as tall as one of the Gauls whom he once impersonated. The dozen of Decimus&#x2019;s letters that survive mix the coarse atmosphere of the camp with the formal politeness and self-assurance of a Roman noble. Elegant at times, his prose also includes clumsy phrases like, &#x201c;just take the bit between your teeth and start talking.&#x201d; Perhaps some of the roughness of his gladiators&#x2014;Decimus owned a troupe&#x2014;rubbed off on him but, if so, it didn&#x2019;t stop him from trading pleasantries with Rome&#x2019;s greatest orator, Marcus Tullius Cicero.<br> <br>In Gaul, Decimus joined the greatest military adventure of his generation. It took Caesar only eight years (58&#x2013;50 B.C.) to conquer the big, populous, warlike region that the Romans called &#x201c;Long-Haired Gaul,&#x201d; after the flowing tresses of its people&#x2014;an area that comprised most of France, all of Belgium, part of the Netherlands, and a sliver of Germany (the Provence region of France was already a Roman province). (He also invaded Britain.) With its gold, agricultural produce, and potential slaves, Gaul made Caesar the richest man in Rome. He shared the wealth with officers like Decimus.<br> <br>After his victory at sea off Brittany in 56 B.C., Decimus next appears in 52 B.C., when a great Gallic revolt almost broke Roman rule. Decimus took part in the most dramatic day of the war at the siege of Alesia (in today&#x2019;s Burgundy). As Caesar tells the story, Decimus began the countercharge against a Gallic offensive and Caesar followed, conspicuous in his reddish purple cloak. The enemy collapsed and the war was over except for mopping-up operations the following year.<br> <br>In 50 B.C. Decimus was back in Rome for his first elective office&#x2014;quaestor, a financial official. That same year, in April, Decimus married Paula Valeria, who came from a noble family. There was scandal here to wink at because in order to marry Decimus she divorced her previous husband, a prominent man, on the very day he was scheduled to come back from service in a province abroad.<br> <br>A year after Decimus and Paula married, in 49 B.C., civil war broke out between Caesar and his oligarchic opponents. They considered him a power-hungry, populist demagogue who threatened their way of life. He found them narrow-minded reactionaries who insulted his honor&#x2014;and no one paid more attention to honor than a Roman noble.<br> <br>Caesar&#x2019;s chief opponents were Pompey and Cato. Pompey the Great&#x2014;Cnaeus Pompeius Magnus&#x2014;was no ideologue; in fact, he was Caesar&#x2019;s former political ally and son-in-law. A conqueror whose career took him to Hispania, Roman Asia (modern Turkey), and the Levant, Pompey was Rome&#x2019;s greatest living general until Caesar. Marcus Porcius Cato, also known as Cato the Younger, was a prominent senator, loyal to the old-fashioned notion of a free state guided by a wise and wealthy elite. Rigid and doctrinaire, he was mocked for thinking that Rome was the Republic of Plato when others regarded it as the Sewer of Romulus. He was Caesar&#x2019;s archenemy.<br> <br>Most of Decimus&#x2019;s family tended to sympathize with Pompey and Cato, and his wife&#x2019;s brothers fought for them. As an adult, Decimus was adopted into the family of Postumius Albinus, a patrician clan that claimed an ancestor opposed to Rome&#x2019;s kings, and his adoptive family had conservative leanings, too. Yet Decimus remained in Caesar&#x2019;s camp. It was probably early in 49 B.C. that Decimus issued coins celebrating his victories in Gaul, his loyalty, his sense of duty and spirit of unity&#x2014;all propaganda themes of Caesar&#x2019;s in the civil war.<br> <br>That same year Caesar named Decimus admiral for the siege of the city of Massilia (Marseille), an important seaport and naval base on Gaul&#x2019;s Mediterranean coast that supported Caesar&#x2019;s enemies. In the six-month struggle that followed, Decimus destroyed Massilia&#x2019;s fleet. He won Caesar&#x2019;s praise for his vigor, spirit, oratorical skill, foresight, and speed in combat. He gave Caesar&#x2019;s cause a propaganda boost because until then, Pompey had monopolized naval glory.<br> <br>Caesar now returned to Italy and then turned east for a showdown with Pompey. He left Decimus in Massilia to serve as governor of Gaul through 45 B.C. as his deputy. Decimus then acquired additional military renown by defeating the rebellious Bellovaci, said to be Gaul&#x2019;s best warriors.<br> <br>Decimus seems as hard as the country in which he spent much of his adult life. He was one of those Romans&#x2014;they were rare, but probably less rare than the sources admit&#x2014;who took on the manners and customs of the barbarians he fought. He spoke the Gaulish language, which few Romans did, and he knew the country well enough to be able to put on Gallic clothes and pass as a local.<br> <br>Around July 45 B.C. Decimus met Caesar in southern Gaul on his way back from Hispania. There Decimus no doubt rendered his accounts of the province that he had governed in the dictator&#x2019;s absence. That Caesar was well pleased with Decimus is clear from the position of honor that Caesar gave him on the return to Italy.<br> <br>After more than a decade in Caesar&#x2019;s service, Decimus came home rich, a hero, and on the rise. He was about to take office as one of the praetors (high judicial officials) in Rome for the rest of 45 B.C. Caesar had chosen him as governor-designate of Italian Gaul (that is, roughly, northern Italy) for 44 B.C. and consul-designate for 42 B.C.<br> <br>In short, Decimus was well on his way to restoring his family&#x2019;s fame. There was only one hitch. Decimus&#x2019;s father and grandfather held office by the free choice of the Roman people and at the command of the Senate. Decimus did everything on Caesar&#x2019;s say-so. That accorded poorly with the cherished ideal of every Roman noble, dignitas. It&#x2019;s a difficult word to translate. In addition to &#x201c;dignity,&#x201d; it means &#x201c;worth,&#x201d; &#x201c;prestige,&#x201d; and &#x201c;honor.&#x201d; Perhaps the best single translation is &#x201c;rank.&#x201d;<br> <br>The question now for Decimus was whether he would be satisfied to remain in Caesar&#x2019;s shadow or whether he would insist on being his own man.<br> MARK ANTONY<p></p> <br>As Caesar entered Mediolanum on his return homeward, Mark Antony stood beside him in his chariot. Antony looked the part of a hero. Born on January 14, ca. 83 B.C., he was in the prime of life. He was handsome, strong, and athletic. He wore a beard in imitation of Hercules, the demigod whom his family claimed as an ancestor. The Romans connected Hercules with Hispania, which gave symbolic significance to Antony&#x2019;s presence. His personality conveyed vigor. He was gregarious, intelligent, and self-assured. He drank lustily and in public and endeared himself to his soldiers by eating with them. If Caesar&#x2019;s health had declined at all over the years, as some say, then the robust presence of Antony would prove reassuring.<br> <br>Antony came from a senatorial family. His father&#x2019;s people, the Antonii, tended to be moderate conservatives, but Antony&#x2019;s mother, Julia, was Julius Caesar&#x2019;s third cousin. Perhaps that was his ticket to Caesar&#x2019;s staff in Gaul, which Antony joined in 54 B.C.<br> <br>As a youth, Antony had cut a wide swath in Rome, where he became notorious for drinking, womanizing, racking up debts, and keeping bad company. By his mid-twenties, Antony was over his wild ways. He studied oratory in Greece and distinguished himself as a cavalry commander in the East between 58 B.C. and 55 B.C. Already in his earliest armed encounter, he was the first man on the wall during a siege, and he went on in numerous battles to display courage and win victories.<br> <br>Antony&#x2019;s early service for Caesar in Gaul is unrecorded, but it was probably impressive because Caesar sent him back to Rome in 53 B.C. to run for quaestor&#x2014;an election that he won. He then returned to Gaul as one of Caesar&#x2019;s generals and, like Decimus, left with a record full of promise.<br> <br>Also like Decimus, Antony held elective office in Rome in 50 B.C. As one of the ten People&#x2019;s Tribunes, elected each year to represent ordinary people&#x2019;s interests, Antony played a role in that year&#x2019;s fateful clash between Caesar and his opponents in the Senate. Led by Cato, the Senate stripped Caesar of his governorship of Gaul and denied him the chance to run for a second consulship. Caesar feared that, if he returned to Rome, he would be put on trial and unfairly convicted by his enemies. Antony tried to stop the Senate from its moves against Caesar, but he was rebuffed and fled Rome for Caesar&#x2019;s camp.<br> <br>Antony emerged in the Civil War with Pompey as Caesar&#x2019;s best general and an indispensable political operative. He received such key assignments as organizing the defense of Italy, bringing Caesar&#x2019;s legions across an enemy-infested Adriatic Sea, and linking up with Caesar in Roman Macedonia. Antony played his most important role at the Battle of Pharsalus in central Greece on August 9, 48 B.C., when he commanded Caesar&#x2019;s left flank in the decisive battle against Pompey. When Caesar&#x2019;s veterans broke Pompey&#x2019;s ranks, Antony&#x2019;s cavalry chased the fleeing enemy.<br> <br>It was a sudden and terrible defeat for Caesar&#x2019;s enemies. They still had cards to play&#x2014;hundreds of warships, thousands of soldiers, major allies, and plenty of money. But with the sight of thousands of Pompey&#x2019;s dead soldiers at the end of the Battle of Pharsalus, you could almost hear the sound of the political tide turning in the Sewer of Romulus.<br> <br>While he spent the next year in the East, winning allies, raising money, conquering rebels, and wooing a new mistress, Caesar sent Antony back to Rome. There Antony arranged for Caesar to be dictator for the year and for himself to be Master of the Horse (Magister Equitum), as a dictator&#x2019;s second-in-command was called. This was Caesar&#x2019;s second dictatorship. It dismayed lovers of liberty. Meanwhile, traditionalists took offense at Antony&#x2019;s rowdy and degenerate lifestyle, which he resumed with abandon. The sources speak of wild nights, public hangovers, vomiting in the Forum, and chariots pulled by lions. It was hard to miss his affair with an actress and ex-slave with the stage name of Cytheris, &#x201c;Venus&#x2019;s Girl,&#x201d; since she and Antony traveled together in public in a litter.<br> <br>Both civil and military politics in Rome slipped out of Antony&#x2019;s hands. When proponents of debt relief and rent control turned violent, Antony sent troops into the Forum and blood flowed&#x2014;the troops killed eight hundred men. Meanwhile, some of Caesar&#x2019;s veteran legions, now back in Italy, mutinied for pay and demobilization.<br> <br>The situation called for Caesar&#x2019;s firm hand, and he returned to Rome in the fall. He put down the mutiny and agreed to reduce rents, although he refused to cancel debts. As for Antony, Caesar always knew how to turn people&#x2019;s weaknesses to his advantage. After speaking against Antony in the Senate, Caesar turned around and gave him a new assignment.<br> <br>It was a job that most Romans would have turned down, but not Antony. He lacked political finesse, but he didn&#x2019;t mind getting his hands dirty and he was loyal. Caesar gave Antony the job of selling all of Pompey&#x2019;s confiscated assets to various privat...</p><h2>THE THANOS WARS: INFINITY ORIGIN OMNIBUS (The Thanos Wars: Infinity Origin Marvel Omnibus)</h2><p>Before he eradicated half the Marvel Universe, Thanos fought his first Infinity Gem-powered wars against Captain Marvel, Adam Warlock and the combined might of the Avengers.

Or you have persistent pain you and your doctor can&#39;t explain. Man or woman, you may be fighting fluctuating hormone levels. Or maybe you snore like a freight train. Anything that narrows the throat and interrupts sleep, particularly breathing problems brought on by sleep position, illness, life changes, or your anatomy, may be key to understanding a host of common health issues. In this groundbreaking book, Dr. Steven Park outlines a simple, rational explanation for what s making you sick, and provides guidance for treatment options that address specific health problems.</p><p>Dr. Park&#39;s revelation was eye-popping. It started with seeing patient after patient presenting similar histories: chronic sinus, ear, or throat problems, stress, fatigue, depression, and surprisingly, trouble sleeping on their backs. He began to suspect a connection between breathing problems at night and their various health and wellness issues. He knew that, anatomy-wise, the human ability to speak is actually a liability when it comes to breathing efficiency-humans are the only animals that can choke and die. If his patients&#39; night breathing was poor, not only were they not getting good sleep, it could be tipping the balance of their health, making them vulnerable to a host of illnesses and conditions.On the other hand, if they&#39;re experiencing health conditions or illnesses that obstruct nighttime breathing, that could be the beginning of a vicious cycle: health problem, poor breathing during sleep, more health problems. The breakthrough came when he began to treat the night breathing and sleep position parts of the equation. Lo and behold, his patients showed immediate and drastic improvement in their health complaints.Sleep, Interrupted takes you step-by-step through the widespread problems created by obstructed breathing at night.

Some of the umpires in this league braved home plate without the mask, but Jason&#x2019;s parents had insisted he wear one. Based on the symptoms Jason had described back in June, doctors had concluded that a concussion must have initiated the mysterious disappearance that ended when he showed up at a farmhouse in Iowa, claiming he had no recollection of the prior four months.<br> <br>The small pitcher went into his stretch. He glanced at the runner on third, then at the runner on first. The pitcher was in a tight spot. It was the third round of the summer league playoffs. His team led by one run, this was the final inning, there were two outs, and the count was three balls, two strikes. The pudgy kid at the plate was the second-best hitter on the opposing team.<br> <br>The runner on first was taking a huge lead. The pitcher stepped off the rubber and winged the ball to the first baseman. The runner dove to make it back to the bag, then asked for time so he could stand.<br> <br>The pitcher got the ball back. Again the runner on first took a greedy lead. The pitcher threw to first again, but the first baseman dropped the ball. Although the baseball did not roll far, the runner on third dashed for home. The batter backed away.<br> <br>&#x201c;Throw home!&#x201d; the pitcher yelled as the first baseman grabbed the ball.<br> <br>The ball streaked through the air to the catcher, who had the runner beat. The runner dropped his shoulder, plowing into the catcher as he got tagged before stepping on home plate. The little catcher flopped backward into the dirt, the ball dropping from his mitt.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re out,&#x201d; Jason called, pumping his fist.<br> <br>The players on the field cheered. The coach of the opposing team, a skinny man with a dark suntan and a darker mustache, charged over to Jason. The coach was already hollering before he reached home plate, eyes bulging, spittle flying from his chapped lips. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with you, ump? What kind of call was that? This is our season! Are you blind? He dropped the ball!&#x201d;<br> <br>Taking off his mask, Jason stared at the outraged coach. Within the past six months, Jason had confronted a giant bloodthirsty crab, outfoxed a brilliant chancellor, dueled a vengeful duke, and defied an evil emperor. He was not intimidated by Coach Leo. The coach kicked dust at him and gestured wildly. Veins stood out in his neck. Apparently he was emulating the tantrum of some major league manager he had seen on television.<br> <br>Matt, the first base umpire, hurried over. He got between Jason and the furious coach. &#x201c;Hey, settle down,&#x201d; he insisted.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay,&#x201d; Jason said, stepping around his friend. &#x201c;Look, do you want to listen to me or get banned from this league?&#x201d;<br> <br>The coach closed his mouth, hands on his hips, eyes smoldering. His expression warned that nothing Jason could say would appease him.<br> <br>&#x201c;The rules of this league demand that the runner slide for a close play at home.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What kind of rule is that?&#x201d; The coach remained angry, but sounded less certain.<br> <br>&#x201c;A rule to prevent nine-year-old catchers from being hospitalized. If your runner had beaten the throw, I&#x2019;d make an exception, but he was tagged and only made it home because he didn&#x2019;t slide. Next season, learn the rules, then teach them to your players.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ump&#x2019;s right, Leo,&#x201d; the scorekeeper drawled from behind the backstop.<br> <br>The coach sneered but had no reply. He glanced around at the parents staring at him from the aluminum bleachers, then turned to glare at Jason, as if blaming him for the embarrassing display.<br> <br>Jason raised his eyebrows.<br> <br>The coach returned to his dugout.<br> <br>&#x201c;Good job,&#x201d; Matt said, clapping Jason on the back. &#x201c;Way to keep cool.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I have to remind myself these guys are just somebody&#x2019;s dad, desperate to see their kid win. In a way it&#x2019;s nice that they care.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sports turn a lot of people into hotheads,&#x201d; Matt said.<br> <br>Jason took a deep breath, trying to dismiss the incident. &#x201c;Should we get out of here?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d; They started walking toward their bikes. The teams huddled up to shout cheers. &#x201c;Are you coming to Tim&#x2019;s party tonight?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The pool party? I don&#x2019;t know. Maybe.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on,&#x201d; Matt urged. &#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be fun. It won&#x2019;t stay warm forever.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll see.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Which means no,&#x201d; Matt sighed. &#x201c;At some point you should consider rejoining the living.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jason was unsure how to respond. How could he explain what was really troubling him? His friends assumed that his reclusive behavior was due to his newfound infamy following the four months when he had dropped off the map. His disappearance had made the national news, as had his sudden reappearance after most had assumed he was dead. True, his absence had created some serious hassles. There had been dozens of interview requests. While some reporters were supportive, others had accused him of faking the incident, of deliberately hiding. Plus, the lost time had complicated his schooling. After counseling with his parents and teachers, Jason had spent much of the summer finishing packets of work that would enable him to advance to the next grade in the fall.<br> <br>His real problem was not being able to tell anyone the truth. He had been to another world. He had made friends there, and enemies. He had risked his life and had accomplished great deeds. And he had returned home against his will, leaving behind tons of unfinished business. He had left a girl from Washington stranded there. And he knew a vital secret that would change how the heroes of that world tried to resist the emperor Maldor.<br> <br>How could he explain any of this to Matt? To his parents? No matter what evidence he produced or details he supplied, nobody could possibly believe him. These burdens had to remain private. Although his experiences in Lyrian consumed his thoughts, if he tried to share what had really happened, he would wind up in a mental hospital!<br> <br>Of all his friends, Matt had tried the hardest to be there for him. After returning from Lyrian, Jason had quit playing baseball. His prior goals as a pitcher had seemed insignificant compared to his new concerns. But he still loved the game, so he had volunteered during the summer as an umpire for a couple of the younger leagues. The volunteer gig carried little pressure and required much less time than actually playing and practicing. Matt had volunteered as well, just to hang out with him.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; Jason said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m no fun anymore. I&#x2019;ve warned you, my head is a mess. I wish I could explain.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry about it,&#x201d; Matt said, grabbing his bike. &#x201c;Who wouldn&#x2019;t feel a little different after all you&#x2019;ve been through? Nobody minds. Nobody who matters. If you could just relax, you&#x2019;d see that not so much has changed. Who cares whether you pitch or not? Everyone wants you around again.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; Jason said, stuffing his umpire gear into a sports bag. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll try to come.&#x201d;<br> <br>Matt studied him. &#x201c;We could go together. Want me to swing by?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Better not.&#x201d;<br> <br>Matt nodded knowingly. &#x201c;How about some lunch? You hungry?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m good. Maybe I&#x2019;ll see you tonight.&#x201d;<br> <br>Matt shrugged. &#x201c;Have it your way. Catch you later.&#x201d;<br> <br>Matt pedaled away on his bike. Jason climbed onto his own bike and headed home. If he wasn&#x2019;t careful, soon he&#x2019;d have no friends left. Was he deliberately pushing everyone away? Having unfinished business in Lyrian did not guarantee he would find a way back there. Like it or not, he might need to start living an actual life in this world again. After all, school would resume in less than a month. A regular schedule would make it much tougher to behave like a hermit.<br> <br>When Jason got home, he left his bike in the garage and looked out back for Shadow, his Labrador. He came up empty. Nobody was home. His parents had grown closer to the dog during Jason&#x2019;s absence and had probably taken him for a walk.<br> <br>Jason retreated to his room. He had spent a lot of time there lately. He went to his closet and got down a shoe box from the top shelf. From a drawer he collected a spiral notebook and a pen. Removing a pair of rubber bands, he opened the shoe box and took out a human hand. The severed wrist revealed a perfect cross section of bone, muscle, tendon, nerves, and blood vessels.<br> <br>H-E-L-L-O. Jason traced the letters on the palm. He set the hand down and picked up his pen, ready to transcribe.<br> <br>Not now, the hand spelled hastily in sign language.<br> <br>Ferrin must be in some sort of trouble again. Jason had established contact with the displacer not long after returning from Iowa. He had taught Ferrin the sign language alphabet using a book from the public library. The tedious communication was his only link to Lyrian, and Jason had faithfully logged all of their conversations.<br> <br>Jason felt grateful for the living hand. It represented his only tangible evidence of all that had happened. Without it, he wondered if he would eventually have come to believe his months in a parallel universe had been an elaborate delusion.<br> <br>Back in June, soon after receiving word from their son, Jason&#x2019;s parents had driven from Colorado to pick him up in Iowa. His father had good insurance, so not long after Jason related his story of a four-month blackout during which he had somehow traveled hundreds of miles to awaken wearing filthy homespun clothes in a cornfield, he was referred to a neurologist. Jason affirmed to the specialist that he recalled nothing after reporting for work the day he was tagged in the head by a baseball, resisting the temptation to fabricate a horrific tale of alien abductors, sterile lights, and invasive probes. When asked how he got to Iowa, Jason had theorized that he might be a narcoleptic sleepwalker.<br> <br>After an MRI, the neurologist confirmed that if the blow had resulted in a concussion, as she assumed based on the symptoms Jason had described, it had left no lasting visible damage. Jason was diagnosed with some form of anterograde amnesia, which the neurologist explained as an inability to remember events subsequent to brain trauma.<br> <br>Jason had a hunch that the neurologist didn&#x2019;t wholly believe the story, but she never went so far as to call him a liar. His parents had been perplexed that given all the media attention Jason&#x2019;s disappearance had received, nobody had noticed him wandering the country for months as an amnesiac. They had insisted that Jason see a therapist, who had blatantly tried to investigate whether Jason was telling the truth about his lost months, but all Jason confessed to was a dream involving many of the details from Lyrian. In the end, the scrutiny had finally subsided.<br> <br>Jason had considered confessing everything to his parents and trying to use the severed hand as evidence. But he had finally decided that although the lively hand was an inexplicable oddity, it was far from concrete proof that he had journeyed to another world. The hand would only raise a more lingering batch of unanswerable questions.<br> <br>After putting the hand back into the shoe box, Jason went to his computer and turned it on. Besides the hand, he had one other source of evidence that his trip to Lyrian had actually happened. He went into his photos folder, then clicked through a maze of folders within folders until arriving at one marked &#x201c;Rachel.&#x201d;<br> <br>Inside that folder, he found images of Rachel Marie Woodruff, a thirteen-year-old girl from Olympia, Washington, who had gone missing in Arches National Park the same day that Jason had vanished. Jason had acquired the images from sites all over the Internet.<br> <br>Apparently wealth and connections mattered, because Rachel&#x2019;s parents had managed to turn her disappearance into one of the biggest news stories of the year. The case was particularly baffling because the family had been alone with a guide in such remote country. Rachel had vanished quickly and quietly. The huge team of hastily summoned rescuers had found no body and no trace of violence. Her tracks had led to a natural stone arch where all evidence abruptly ceased.<br> <br>For earning media exposure, it also didn&#x2019;t hurt that Rachel was quite photogenic and her family had dozens of recent pictures to display. Not to mention that her father had offered a no-questions-asked million-dollar reward for information leading to her recovery.<br> <br>Jason studied a color photo of Rachel looking up from a canvas she was painting. Another showed her beside a skinny blonde, both of them wearing track uniforms. A third was just her head and shoulders, taken in a studio. She looked like the cute girl next door, but with a little extra style, both in her haircut and her fashion.<br> <br>Jason had considered making an anonymous call to her parents, just to let them know that he had seen her and that she was all right. But such contact posed several problems. First off, Rachel might not be okay anymore. Last Jason had heard, she had been on the run with Tark, pursued by imperial soldiers. Secondly, if her parents somehow traced the call to him, he had no alibi. He had gone missing at the same time, which would make him a very appealing suspect if he was ever connected to the case. And lastly, he had no idea if Rachel would ever make it home, so it might be cruel to give her parents false hope.<br> <br>Switching off his computer, Jason rose and started pacing. He hated being the only person in the world who knew where Rachel had gone. He hated being the only person in the world who might be able to bring her back. He hated being the only person in the world who knew that the secret word that could supposedly destroy the wizard Maldor was actually an elaborate hoax meant to distract and measure his enemies.<br> <br>Jason undressed and took a shower. After drying off and dressing, he stood and stared at himself in the mirror. He had not regained much of the weight he had lost in Lyrian. In spite of his absence from baseball, Jason had exercised vigorously ever since returning home. He threw pitches in the backyard. He jogged. He did sit-ups, push-ups, and pull-ups. He bought books on karate and practiced in his room.<br> <br>&#x201c;You know where you&#x2019;re going,&#x201d; Jason told his reflection. &#x201c;You always go there when you&#x2019;re feeling like this. No point in waiting around.&#x201d;<br> <br>He went and removed the hand from the shoe box and placed it in a plastic grocery sack, which he wadded into a black backpack stocked with provisions. He wore a gray T-shirt and tied a lightweight jacket around his waist. He put on a new pair of sturdy boots, zipped a disposable waterproof camera into a jacket pocket, shrugged into the backpack, and slipped a pocketknife into his jeans pocket, just in case today would be the day.<br> <br>At the Vista Point Zoo, Jason pulled the season pass from his wallet and flashed it to get inside. Ignoring the crowds, he strode directly to the hippo tank. As he had done on more than twenty occasions since returning to Colorado, Jason took up his regular position leaning against the guardrail.<br> <br>The first time he had revisited the zoo, Jason had intended to leap into the tank and get swallowed by the hippo again. But as he stood staring at the lethargic beast, doubts had begun to assail him. What if the hippo was no longer a gateway? It could have been a one-time occurrence. What if the hippo refused to swallow him? What if it mauled him after witnesses watched him intentionally enter the tank?

He has published well over 300 books and articles and has been invited to deliver more than 300 lectures at universities throughout the United States and abroad. His widely known theory of second-language acquisition has had a huge impact on all areas of second-language research and teaching since the 1970s. This book amounts to a summary and assessment by Krashen of much of his work thus far, as well as a compilation of his thoughts about the future.</p> <p>Here, readers can follow Krashen as he </p><ul> <li>reviews the fundamentals of second-language acquisition theory </li><li>presents some of the original research supporting the theory and more recent studies </li><li>offers counterarguments to criticisms </li><li>explores new areas that have promise for progress in both theory and application. </li></ul> An invaluable resource on the results of Krashen's many years of research and application, this book covers a wide range of topics: from the role of the input/comprehension hypothesis (and its current rival-the comprehensible output hypothesis), the still-very-good idea of free voluntary reading, and current issues and controversies about teaching grammar, to considerations of how it is we grow intellectually, or how we "get smart."<p></p></p><p><p>Stephen Krashen is Emeritus Professor of Education at the University of Southern California. He is best known for his work in establishing a general theory of second language acquisition, as the cofounder of the Natural Approach, and as the inventor of sheltered subject matter teaching. He is the author of numerous books, including Three Arguments Against Whole Language and Why They Are Wrong (1999), Every Person a Reader: An Alternative to the California Task Force Report on Reading (1997), and Under Attack: The Case Against Bilingual Education (1997), all available from Heinemann.</p></p><h2>Cross-Country Cat</h2><p><p>What kind of cat would go sliding off on skis, and who'd believe it anyway?

He has won several state awards selected by young readers, as well as an American Book Award for <em>Porcupine Stew</em>, and he is widely known for his work on Mary Calhoun's four beloved Henry the Cat books.</p><p>"I don't think I've ever had a stroke of genius. Maybe luck, but not genius. It's all been hard work. The brilliance comes in the writing. I am most interested in illustrating stories with strong plots. The concept should be positive and uplifting, and the setting should be wholesome, if not magical. I can tell by the second reading of a manuscript if it's going to work. I can't force that excitement. Once I find a manuscript I like, I look at it as a child would--I don't use adult skills to start the book. I get my ideas in very, very sketchy form, almost like doodling. The more time I spend on a book, the less childlike my perspective is, but I never lose that aspect, because I've already thought it all out in a childlike way.</p><p>Children's book illustrations must create a magical bridge between the fascination of the story and the actual text. I try not only to lure the child to the story for the first time but to bring the reader back again and again. I take what the text requires of me--my experience, my drawing skills-and weave it together. With clear understanding and compassion for the author's intent, I place my imagery within a realistic, well researched, and believable setting. Imagination, research, a well-thought-out arrangement, and attention to detail will continue to he integral parts of my work."</p><p>Erick Ingraham was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on December 23, 1950.

In thoughtful, discerning prose, she explores how we come to inhabit the world we see, and how that world also inhabits us. Her voice is a steady assurance that we can, and do, chart our spiritual geography wherever we go.</p></p><p>After 20 years of living in the "Great American Outback," as <i>Newsweek</i> magazine once designated the Dakotas, poet Kathleen Norris (<i>The Cloister Walk</i>) came to understand the fascinating ways that people become metaphors for the land they inhabit. When trying to understand the polarizing contradictions that exist in the Dakotas between "hospitality and insularity, change and inertia, stability and instability.... between hope and despair, between open hearts and closed minds," Norris draws a map. "We are at the point of transition between east and west in the United States," she explains, "geographically and psychically isolated from either coast, and unlike either the Midwest or the desert west."<p> Like Terry Tempest Williams (<i>Refuge</i>), Norris understands how the boundary between inner and outer scenery begins to blur when one is fully present in the landscape of their lives. As a result, she offers the geography lesson we all longed for in school. This is a poetic, noble, and often funny (see her discussion on the foreign concept of tofu) tribute to Dakota, including its Native Americans, Benedictine monks, ministers and churchgoers, wind-weathered farmers, and all its plain folks who live such complicated and simple lives. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>Kathleen Norris is the author of two books of poetry, Falling Off (1971) and The Middle of the World (1981) and has received awards from the Guggenheim and Bush foundations.

Maybe they get married, or maybe their time together will be tragically short.<br> Nick Payne's <i>Constellations</i> is a play about free will and friendship; it's also about quantum multiverse theory, love, and honey.</p></p><p><p><b>Nick Payne </b>is the author of the plays <i>If There Is I Haven't Found It Yet</i>, which won the London Evening Standard Theatre Award for best play; <i>Wanderlust</i>;<i> One Day When We Were Young</i>; and <i>Lay Down Your Cross</i>, among others.

He was born in 1984 and lives in Norwich, England.</p><p>&#x201c;Who knew that higher physics could be so sexy, so accessible--and so emotionally devastating? <i>Constellations</i>, Nick Payne's gorgeous two-character drama, starring a perfectly matched Jake Gyllenhaal and Ruth Wilson, may be the most sophisticated date play Broadway has seen.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Ben Brantley, The New York Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;The play may fixate on physics, but the chemistry between the two leads is potent enough to move an audience to tears.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Alexis Soloski, The Guardian</i></p><p>&#x201c;The pleasure of the evening lies in the way it is both eminently sensible and completely nonsensical. Details accumulate sufficiently to explain character and plot, while throwing us so off-guard as to make questions of narrative moot . . . Wilson and Gyllenhaal are tasked with showing us how the slightest shift in emphasis can alter a line's meaning. Wilson has the more commanding stage technique while the approach of Gyllenhaal is more halting and affectionate. Their chemistry is palpable.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Brendan Lemon, Financial Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;Short and sweet and strangely haunting . . . Although barely an hour long, this baby bombshell by hot Brit scribe Nick Payne overflows with emotional highs and lows . . .

All of them.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Marilyn Stasio, Variety</i></p><p>&#x201c;Rarely has quantum physics felt as romantic, as lively as it does in Broadway's <i>Constellations</i>.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Elisabeth Vincentelli, New York Post</i></p><p>&#x201c;British playwright Nick Payne's beguiling <i>Constellations</i> is not only a full-bodied narrative, it's a richly affecting experience. That's thanks to the sensitivity of the writing, but also to the warmth, humor and vitality invested in it by Jake Gyllenhaal and Ruth Wilson, giving two astonishing performances in a production from Michael Longhurst that's as rigorous as it is tender.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>David Rooney, The Hollywood Reporter</i></p><p>&#x201c;We've been down similar roads before in pop culture, with <i>Groundhog Day</i> being the classic version. But Payne puts his own stamp on the idea -- and director Michael Longhurst's staging touches both the head and the heart deeply. Even Tom Scutt's lovely set, a bare stage below and beside a huge collection of inflated white balloons, packs a poetic touch. And the cast is swoon-worthy. Gyllenhaal is laid-back and ever-genuine as the passive Roland. Wilson, a two-time Olivier Award winner, is sensual and irresistibly carefree -- a perfect foil. Together, they have something elusive: combustible chemistry. Heavenly sparks ensue.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Joe Dziemianowicz, New York Daily News</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>Constellations</i> is smart but not dry; its focus is on the personal and emotional, and Gyllenhaal and Wilson reboot themselves convincingly at every stutter and turn. They're wonderfully multiversatile.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Adam Feldman, Time Out New York</i></p><p>&#x201c;Despite abrupt scene and mood fluctuations, Gyllenhaal and Wilson perform the tricky repetitions and time shifts with breathtaking smoothness. Wilson expressively signals Marianne's emotions, whether glee or mischief or heartbreaking vulnerability. Gyllenhaal's performance is more opaque, yet he infuses Roland with decency and an earnest desire to communicate with the better-educated, more emotional Marianne.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Jennifer Farrar, Associated Press</i></p><p>&#x201c;Intimate and cosmic concerns are woven together with such grace that they seem inextricable.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Elysa Gardner, USA Today</i></p><p>&#x201c;The actors give true tour-de-force performances ... Wilson, a two-time Olivier award-winner honored on Sunday as best actress in a TV series, duels and parries with her partner to memorable effect, whether she's a sloppily emotional figure out on a first date, or an academic methodically enchanted by the mysteries of the universe.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Robert Kahn, NBC</i></p><p>&#x201c;[Nick Payne is] one of the most dazzlingly gifted dramatists of a new generation--sharp, funny, wise, humane.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Vogue</i></p><p>&#x201c;The nearest I've come across in ages to a play that feels heaven-sent.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Matt Wolf, The New York Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>Constellations</i> gets into your head and under your skin with an immediacy that sometimes tickles and often hurts.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Ben Brantley, The New York Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;Spry, funny and ultimately very moving . . .

But what is in- teresting about Haraway&#x2019;s remark &#x2013; its challenge to the oppositional think- ing that sets up free will against determinism, vitalism against mechanism &#x2013; has seldom been processed by a mode of theorizing which has tended to reproduce exactly the same oppositions. These theoretical failings, it will be argued here, arise from a resistance to pursuing cybernetics to its limits (a failure evinced as much by cyberneticists as by cultural theorists, it must be added). Unraveling the implications of cybernetics, it will be claimed, takes us out to the Gothic flatline. The Gothic flatline designates a zone of radical immanence. And to theorize this flatline demands a new approach, one committed to the theorization of immanence. This thesis calls that approach Gothic Materialism.</p></p><p></p><h2>Citrus Vol. 8</h2><p><p><b>A Couple&#x2019;s Retreat</b></p><p>Yuzu is pumped to go on a summer trip with her friends but she also wants to spend time alone with Mei.

Detective Gordon, a toad, listens patiently. As snow falls in the forest, he investigates the area around the squirrel's tree. A long stakeout leaves the detective ignominiously trapped, frozen and immobilized, under a mound of snow. His first suspect becomes his rescuer and, ultimately, his law-enforcement apprentice: a young mouse named Buffy.

Right now, I&#x2019;ll cart your luggage out there for you.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Thanks very much,&#x201d; Stone said.&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll pick up the key and meet you there.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You want fuel now or later?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Later, please.&#x201d;&nbsp; It would be hot in the hangar, and he didn&#x2019;t want the fuel to expand and leak out of the vents.&nbsp; Stone walked into the FBO lobby, introduced himself and retrieved his car key, then met the lineman outside at his car, a Mercedes 550S Cabriolet, which had been included in the purchase of the house from his business associate, Arthur Steele of the Steele Group of Insurance Companies.&nbsp; Arthur had cleverly rented him the house through an agent, knowing that once Stone had stayed in it, he would want to buy it.&nbsp; Stone&#x2019;s great weakness, along with attractive women and 100-proof bourbon, was houses, of which he now had too many.<br> He tipped the lineman generously, to make a good first impression.<br> The lineman closed the trunk. &#x201c;Just give us a call when you want your airplane, and we&#x2019;ll roll her out for you.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Thanks very much.&#x201d;&nbsp; Stone got into the car, started it, turned on the air conditioning and put down the top.&nbsp; He drove out of the airport and turned down South Roosevelt Boulevard, along Smathers Beach.&nbsp; A ten-minute drive later he was turning into his driveway, which was right next door to a &#x201c;gentleman&#x2019;s club&#x201d; called Bare Assets.&nbsp; He pulled into the carport, as opposed to the garage, and Raul came out of his small house and helped him in with the luggage.&nbsp; They had first met on Stone&#x2019;s last visit to Key West for the Steele Group&#x2019;s board meeting, when he had been a tenant.&nbsp; A housekeeper, Sara, was also part of the deal.<br> The house had once been three small houses on separate lots.&nbsp; A previous owner had moved the smallest one over a dozen feet or so and bolted it to the center house, which contained his study, the dining room, living room, kitchen and bar.&nbsp; The master suite was in the free-standing third house, which had been completely renovated. <br><br>Stone had just deposited his luggage in the master suite when his builder, Karl Walters, turned up to walk him through the house and show him the projects he had completed since Stone had bought it.&nbsp; He showed Stone the new laundry room, the alterations to the kitchen, his study, with its new bookcases, one of them being a secret door to a kitchenette, where there was room for the safe he had ordered.&nbsp; Then he saw the new bar and video room, just completed.<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s beautiful, Karl,&#x201d; Stone said, and I appreciate your fast work on the place.&#x201d;&nbsp; Karl was semi-retired and their mutual attorney, Jack Spottswood had persuaded him to do the project.<br> &#x201c;We aim to please,&#x201d; Karl said.&nbsp; &#x201c;Your boat has had her bottom cleaned and repainted and is back in her berth at the Key West Yacht Club.&#x201d;&nbsp; Jack had just happened to have a recently-widowed client whose late husband&#x2019;s newish Hinckley 43 Jetboat was for sale, and Stone had fallen for that, as well as the house.<br> Karl took him into the study and showed him how the hidden television set rose out of a cabinet, and switched it on.&nbsp; &#x201c;Same thing in the master bedroom.&nbsp; By the way, have you seen the weather lately?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Nope,&#x201d; Stone said, &#x201c;Just my flight weather for the trip down, which was beautiful.&#x201d;<br> Karl switched to the weather channel.&nbsp; &#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t so beautiful,&#x201d; he said.&nbsp; Way down the islands somewhere was a large, angry red spot, labeled Hurricane Irma.<br> &#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s a long way off, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;About a week, maybe less,&#x201d; Karl replied.&nbsp; &#x201c;There are several possible routes showing, and at least one of them is right toward Key West.&nbsp; You&#x2019;d better call your insurance broker and make sure you&#x2019;re coverage is in effect.&nbsp; Same for your boat.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do that,&#x201d; Stone said, staring at the monster, whose winds were labeled 185 mph.<br> Karl shook his hand and left, and Stone wandered through the house again, thinking about what a great decision he&#x2019;d made.&nbsp; Except, maybe, for the fucking hurricane.&nbsp; He went back into the study and looked at the hurricane again.&nbsp; It didn&#x2019;t look any better.&nbsp; He switched off the TV, and it sank back into its cabinet.<br> Stone&#x2019;s cell phone rang and he took it from his holster.&nbsp; The caller&#x2019;s name was blocked.&nbsp; &#x201c;Hello?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Hello from Havana,&#x201d; Holly Barker said.&nbsp; Holly was Secretary of State in President Katharine Lee&#x2019;s administration and was there for the ceremonial opening of the remodeled and enlarged United States Embassy.<br> &#x201c;I hope you&#x2019;re still on schedule,&#x201d; he said.<br> &#x201c;I am.&nbsp; I&#x2019;ll get dropped off around noon tomorrow.&nbsp; I&#x2019;ll call you just before takeoff.&nbsp; Say, how long is the runway there?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;4800 feet,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;I just landed on it.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I guess it can take a government Gulfstream, then.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;It can take a Boeing 737,&#x201d; he replied, &#x201c;so yeah, I guess it can handle a Gulfstream.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I assume I won&#x2019;t need much in the way of clothes in Key West, so I&#x2019;ll be traveling light.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;As far as I&#x2019;m concerned, you won&#x2019;t need <i>anything</i> in the way of clothes.&nbsp; &#x201c;Maybe a bikini, in case we have guests.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You sound just the tiniest bit randy,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;though I probably shouldn&#x2019;t mention that on this line.&nbsp; The ears of the fellas at Cuban intelligence are now pricked up, you should excuse the expression.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll continue this discussion later,&#x201d; he said.&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll talk to you tomorrow.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;When are Dino and Viv arriving?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Couple of days,&#x201d; he said.<br> &#x201c;Good.&nbsp; Bye-bye.&#x201d;&nbsp; She hung up.<br> &nbsp;<br> He took one more stroll around the place, then decided to have dinner at the yacht club bar.&nbsp; He&#x2019;d stop and have a look at <i>Indian Summer,</i> his new Hinckley, on the way to dinner.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Stone drove to the Key West Yacht Club as the sun was setting.&nbsp; The air was warm and humid, but driving with the top down kept him comfortable.&nbsp; He parked in the club&#x2019;s lot, then walked to the outer dock where his Hinckley 43 was berthed.&nbsp; She was well-moored to two pilings on either side, and her electrical cord was plugged into the dock&#x2019;s supply.&nbsp; He&nbsp; stepped aboard and unlocked the sliding glass door and stepped into the cherry-paneled saloon, which contained seating and two tables that could take six for dinner.&nbsp; Beyond that to the left was the galley with drawers for refrigeration and freezing.&nbsp; To the right were two comfortable, raised chairs facing the instrument panel, which contained two large Garmin screens and all the switches for everything electrical on the motor yacht.&nbsp; Below and forward was a generous head with a glass-enclosed shower.&nbsp; Across the companionway was a small guest cabin that could sleep two friendly people in comfort, and forward was the master cabin, with its large bed, cupboards and a bulkhead-mounted TV. <br><br>He went back to the center of the boat and inspected the large circuit-breaker panel, to be sure the switches were in the right positions, then he had one more look around, discovering the TV that lowered into position for viewing, then he locked the glass door and walked up to the club, feeling a terrible thirst.<br> Music greeted him as he entered the crowded bar: a man whose sign introduced him as Bobby Nesbitt, was playing a grand piano and singing Cole Porter.&nbsp; Cal Waters, the builder who had done work on his house, waved him to a stool at the bar and introduced him to his wife, Stacy, a beautiful blonde, and bought him a drink.<br> &#x201c;I trust you found your new house and boat in good order,&#x201d; Stacy said.<br> &#x201c;In perfect order, thanks to Cal, Raul and Sara.&nbsp; Raul, he knew, worked with Cal on his various projects.&nbsp; The good news was that the yacht club bar stocked Knob Creek bourbon, and he soon found one in his fist.<br> &#x201c;Are you all alone down here?&#x201d; Stacy asked.<br> &#x201c;Now, don&#x2019;t start fixing Stone up,&#x201d; Cal said.<br> &#x201c;You won&#x2019;t need to,&#x201d; Stone said.&nbsp; &#x201c;A lady friend is arriving tomorrow and will be here for as long as I can talk her into staying.<br> Cal pointed an one of the two TVs in the bar, which was tuned to the Weather Channel with the sound muted.&nbsp; &#x201c;That might run you both out of town,&#x201d; Cal said.&nbsp; &#x201c;They&#x2019;re saying she&#x2019;s due this weekend.&#x201d;&nbsp; The TV was displaying a red-coned area that was predicted to contain the hurricane, and Key West was well inside it.<br> &#x201c;I hadn&#x2019;t planned on that; are you getting out?&#x201d; Stone asked.<br> &#x201c;Nope,&#x201d; Cal replied.&nbsp; &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll ride it out at our house.&nbsp; I built it myself, and it&#x2019;s framed in steel.&nbsp; How about you?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not as brave as you, Cal,&#x201d; Stone replied.&nbsp; &#x201c;When it starts threatening, I&#x2019;ll jump into my airplane and leave for someplace dry.&nbsp; I&#x2019;ll be glad to give you two a lift.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;We have our own airplane,&#x201d; Cal said, &#x201c;and if we change our minds we&#x2019;ll head for our brother-in-law&#x2019;s house in Santa Fe or our own house in Aspen.&nbsp; We had a bad one, Wilma, a few years ago that flooded this yacht club and most of this side of town.&nbsp; The main road over there was under four feet of water, and the yacht club was a mess.&nbsp; Have you made arrangements to haul your boat?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;What do you advise?&#x201d; Stone said. <br><br>&#x201c;Well, we have a fifty-foot trawler that Raul and I converted to a motor yacht, and its berth is up by the club entrance.&nbsp; I think it&#x2019;ll be all right there.&nbsp; I think yours will be all right, too, if you double up on the lines and put some big fenders out.&nbsp; I&#x2019;ll find you some space ashore, though, if you&#x2019;d rather haul her.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I think your advice sounds good,&#x201d; Stone said.&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll stop into the chandlery and pick up some extra gear.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Will you join us for dinner?&#x201d; Cal asked.&nbsp; &#x201c;We have a table booked over there.&#x201d;&nbsp; He nodded to the adjoining room where the piano rested.<br> &#x201c;Thank you, I will,&#x201d; Stone said.<br> They occupied their table and ordered dinner and wine.<br> &#x201c;Tell me about your girl who&#x2019;s coming,&#x201d; Stacy said.<br> &#x201c;Her name is Holly; she&#x2019;s ex-army, and she used to be chief of police in a town called Orchid Beach, up the east coast, which is where we met some years ago.&nbsp; She went to work for the government after that.&nbsp; I live in New York, and she&#x2019;s in Washington, now, so we don&#x2019;t see each other as often as we&#x2019;d like.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Stacy regards any unmarried man as a challenge to her match-making skills, so watch out.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Any more like you at home, Stacy?&#x201d; Stone asked.<br> &#x201c;Three sisters, but I married the last one off to the guy with the house in Santa Fe.&nbsp; Sorry about that.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Oh, well.&#x201d;&nbsp; Dinner came, and as they were eating, Stone saw two men walk into the club, stop and look around.&nbsp; They were both in their late thirties or early forties and had a hard look about them.<br> &#x201c;Who are they?&#x201d; Stone asked.<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Cal said.&nbsp; &#x201c;I was over at the Galleon Marina this afternoon, and they came in aboard a cigarette-style boat, what the drug runners around here used to use.&nbsp; There aren&#x2019;t so many of them anymore, though.&nbsp; Those two don&#x2019;t look friendly.&#x201d;<br> The two men were approached by another, younger man, who conversed briefly with them, and they turned and left, looking sour.<br> &#x201c;I guess the commodore didn&#x2019;t like the look of them, either,&#x201d; Cal said.&nbsp; &#x201c;I think they just got the members-only brush-off.&nbsp; Normally, if visitors are&nbsp; members of another yacht club,&nbsp; they&#x2019;ll be given club privileges for a few days.&nbsp; I had the feeling those guys were looking for somebody but didn&#x2019;t find him.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Cal is a pretty good judge of human nature,&#x201d; Stacy said.<br> Bobby Nesbitt came back from a drink and asked them for requests.<br> &#x201c;How about some Noel Coward?&#x201d; Stone asked. <br> &#x201c;Done,&#x201d; Bobby said.&nbsp; He sat down and started to play &#x201c;Mad Dogs and Englishmen,&#x201d; then segued into &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see you again.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;He&#x2019;s good,&#x201d; Stone said to the Waters.<br> They finished dinner, had a nightcap, then Stone excused himself.&nbsp; &#x201c;I think I&#x2019;ll turn in,&#x201d; he said.&nbsp; &#x201c;Long flight from New York today.&#x201d;<br> Cal grabbed the check, and Stone said, &#x201c;Next time is mine.&#x201d;<br> As he walked to his car he heard the throaty rumble of a boat that sounded too big for Garrison Bight, where the yacht club was located.&nbsp; He drove out of the club lot, and as he turned right onto North Roosevelt Boulevard, which ran along the water, he saw a cigarette-style boat of, maybe, fifty feet moving around the bight, looking at boats.&nbsp; There were two men aboard, but Stone couldn&#x2019;t see them well enough or long enough to know if they were the two men who&#x2019;d attempted to crash the club.<br> As he drove away, he heard a roar as the boat&#x2019;s engines were briefly revved.&nbsp; It sounded angry.</p><h2>A Grace Revealed: How God Redeems the Story of Your Life</h2><p><p>Twenty years ago, Jerry Sittser lost his daughter, wife, and mother in a car accident.

How can we trust God is involved in our story when our circumstances seem to say he isn&#x2019;t?</p><p>While <em>A Grace Disguised </em>explored how the soul grows through loss, <em>A Grace Revealed</em> brings the story of Sittser&#x2019;s family full circle, revealing God&#x2019;s redeeming work in the midst of circumstances that could easily have destroyed them. As Sittser reminds us, our lives tell a good story after all. <em>A Grace Revealed </em>will helps us understand and trust that God is writing a beautiful story in our own lives.</p></p><p><p>Jerry Sittser is Professor and Chair of Theology at Whitworth University.

One book unlocks an unimaginable truth.</strong><br><br> Salem, Massachusetts, 1681. Fear and suspicion lead a small town to unspeakable acts. Marblehead, Massachusetts, 1991. A young woman is about to discover that she is tied to Salem in ways she never imagined.</p><p>Katherine Howe&#39;s ancestors settled Essex County, Mass. in the 1620s, and stayed there through the twentieth century. Family members included Elizabeth Proctor, who survived the Salem witch trials, and Elizabeth Howe, who did not. Katherine Howe got a Ph.D. in American and New England Studies at Boston University, which included a research seminar on New England witchcraft. The idea for this novel developed while she was studying for her Ph.D. exams, walking her dog through the woods between Marblehead and Salem. She lives in Marblehead, MA with her husband and assorted animals.Graduate student Connie Goodwin stumbles upon a seventeenth-century manuscript belonging to the enigmatic Deliverance Dane. Goodwin&#39;s focus on New England witchcraft in her graduate studies at Harvard provides a platform for listeners to understand the cultural nuances behind Dane&#39;s mysterious narrative. Katherine Kellgren has a timeless voice that makes her a good choice to narrate a novel set in both the 1990s and 1690s. Although her vocal characterizations never stray too far from the voice she uses for the narrative, she believably depicts both genders and centuries. Her subtle American accent cleverly hints at the possibility of British origins, adding credence to the compelling seventeenth-century tale spun by Dane. Listeners will find themselves entertained as well as educated about a misogynistic chapter in American history.

Donald R. Hickey explores the military, diplomatic, and domestic history of our second war with Great Britain, bringing the study up to date with recent scholarship on all aspects of the war, from the Gulf of Mexico to Canada.&nbsp;The newly expanded <i>The War of 1812: A Forgotten Conflict, Bicentennial Edition</i> includes additional information on the British forces, American Indians, and military operations such as the importance of logistics and the use and capabilities of weaponry. Hickey explains how the war promoted American nationalism and manifest destiny, stimulated peacetime defense spending, and enhanced America's reputation abroad. He also shows that the war sparked bloody conflicts between pro-war Republican and anti-war Federalist neighbors, dealt a crippling blow to American Indians, and solidified the United States's antipathy toward the British.</p><p>The War of 1812 gave the United States some of its finest military moments: Admiral Perry's victory on Lake Erie, Andrew Jackson's lopsided triumph at the Battle of New Orleans, the immortal words "Don't give up the ship!," and Fort McHenry's defense of Baltimore (which inspired Francis Scott Key to write "The Star-Spangled Banner"). At the same time, the fighting didn't go especially well for the Americans. Their invasion of Canada failed and the British burned the White House to the ground. The conflict ended in a draw. With <i>The War of 1812: A Forgotten Conflict</i> Donald R. Hickey offers what may be the most comprehensive treatment of the war, and includes many colorful anecdotes. For example, shortly after the mortally wounded James Lawrence uttered "Don't give up the ship!," his men did just that. Their vessel was hauled off to England, broken up, and its timbers used in the construction of a flour mill. The subtitle calls the War of 1812 a "forgotten conflict"; Hickey's excellent book shows why it's worth remembering..

Its combination of clear physical explanations, with direct connections to experimental data, and mathematical rigor make the subject accessible to students with a wide variety of backgrounds and interests. Assuming only an undergraduate-level understanding of quantum mechanics, the book steadily develops the Standard Model and state-of-the art calculation techniques. It includes multiple derivations of many important results, with modern methods such as effective field theory and the renormalization group playing a prominent role. Numerous worked examples and end-of-chapter problems enable students to reproduce classic results and to master quantum field theory as it is used today. Based on a course taught by the author over many years, this book is ideal for an introductory to advanced quantum field theory sequence or for independent study.</p><p>Matthew D. Schwartz is a Professor of Physics at Harvard University. He is one of the world&#39;s leading experts on quantum field theory and its applications to the Standard Model."This is an <b>excellent</b> graduate-level relativistic quantum field theory text, covering an <b>impressive amount of material</b> often with a very novel presentation. It would be ideal either for courses on relativistic quantum field theory or for courses on the Standard Model of elementary particle interactions. The book provides interesting insights and covers many modern topics not usually presented in current texts such as spinor-helicity methods and on-shell recursion relations, heavy quark effective theory and soft-collinear effective field theory. It is nice to see the modern point of view on the predictive power of non-renormalizable theories discussed. <b>Once in a generation</b> particle physicists elevate a quantum field theory text to the <b>rank of classic</b>. Two such classics are the texts by Bjorken and Drell and Peskin and Schroeder; it wouldn't surprise me if this <b>new book by Schwartz joins this illustrious group</b>." <br>Mark Wise, <i>California Institute of Technology</i><br><br>"A <b>wonderful tour</b> of quantum field theory from the modern perspective, filled with insights on both the conceptual underpinnings and the concrete, elegant calculational tools of the subject."<br> Nima Arkani-Hamed, <i>Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton</i><br><br>Matthew Schwartz has produced a <b>new and valuable introduction</b> to quantum field theory. He has <b>rethought the whole presentation of the subject</b>, from the introductory and foundational concepts to new developments such as effective field theory descriptions of quark dynamics. Students will enjoy viewing quantum field theory from his perspective." <br>Michael E. Peskin,<i> SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory</i><br><br>"Schwartz's book grew out of a popular year long course in quantum field theory at Harvard. Designed primarily for graduate students, this course also attracts and inspires a number of undergraduates each year. The book is <b>unique in its combination of breadth, depth and readability</b>. Schwartz starts at the beginning of the subject and brings us right up to the present. That the book is neither superficial nor impossibly dense is <b>rather remarkable</b> and makes it easy to understand the course's success." <br>Howard Georgi, <i>Harvard University</i><br><br>"In this book, Schwartz gives a thoughtful and modern treatment of many classical and contemporary topics.

For Lissianna's 30th birthday, her mother brings her what she considers the perfect birthday present: a psychologist, Greg Hewitt, who can cure her fear of the sight of blood so she can feed off blood-bank bags like a civilized vampire rather than from random humans. The night doesn't go as planned when Lissianna takes a romantic liking to the good doctor. Worse, the clan has trouble controlling his "strong mind" and erasing his memory of the family, putting their secret in jeopardy. Though the love scenes hit an erotic high note, the quick courtship between Lissianna and Greg is serviceable at best, and the first half of the thin plot moves like molasses as Lissianna explains... and explains... to Greg how the vampire race operates. In addition, lines like "They were all looking just as blank as she felt" can make for a clunky read. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The authors seek to explain the unique moral role of the minister and the ethical responsibilities of the vocation and to provide &#34;a clear statement of the ethical obligations contemporary clergy should assume in their personal and professional lives.&#34; Trull and Carter deal with such areas as family life, confidentiality, truth telling, political involvement, working with committees, and relating to other church staff members. First published in 1993, this edition has been thoroughly updated throughout and contains expanded sections on theological foundations, the role of character, confidentiality, and the timely topic of clergy sexual abuse. Appendices describing various denominational ministerial codes of ethics are included.</p><p>Joe E. Trull (ThD, Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary) is editor of Christian Ethics Today and formerly served as professor of Christian ethics at New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary. James E.

Each photo reveals the personality, beauty, and spirit of Baltimore and its people, as his camera complicates popular ideas about the "ghetto."</p><br><br><p>Allen's camera finds hope and beauty doing battle against a system that sows desperation and fear, and above all, resistance, to the unrelenting pressures of racism and poverty in a twenty-first-century American city.</p></p><p>Devin Allen, a Baltimore native, is only the third amateur photographer to have their photograph appear on the cover of Time.

He documents resistance without judgment, without asking the usual questions that outsiders might: Is it justified? Is it effective? Is it legal?

There is a tremendous amount of depth and insight into this work, an exploration of the five elements of life (the &#x2018;five rings&#x2019; of the title) that represent the cosmic Buddha.

Musashi&#x2019;s lessons, in their focus on preparation and mindfulness, can easily be applied to most areas of life. Kutsuwada&#x2019;s art is delicate and clean, balancing the physiological dynamics of swordplay with a clear-eyed appreciation of Musashi&#x2019;s natural environment.

She is also the author of the critically acclaimed <i>The Apple Pie That Papa Baked</i> as well as <i>Leap Back Home to Me</i>; <i>Chew, Chew, Gulp!</i>; and <i>Hop, Hop, Jump!</i> She lives with her husband and son in Brooklyn, New York.*Starred Review* The&nbsp;familiar cumulative tale&nbsp;"The House That Jack Built"&nbsp;receives a gentle, loving twist in this nostalgically illustrated story. The end is the beginning as a pigtailed girl introduces the apple pie "warm and sweet that Papa baked." Then moving backward, the girl runs from her ramshackle house out to the tree "crooked and strong,"&nbsp;where shiny red apples are waiting to be picked. The roots, "deep and fine," feed the tree that grows the apples that go into the pie. Then the&nbsp;text&nbsp;becomes ever more expansive: rain waters the roots, clouds drop&nbsp;the rain, the sky carries the clouds, the sun lights the sky&#x2014;until, finally, the world, blooming with life, spins around the sun and causes the natural wonders that result in&nbsp;one special pie. The text is dear, and it's well matched by delightful illustrations. Bean uses the best of old and&nbsp;new in artwork that&nbsp;harkens back to the&nbsp;works&nbsp;of Lois Lenski,&nbsp;Robert McClosky,&nbsp;and especially Wanda Gag.&nbsp;With dun-colored backgrounds and black-and-gold line work (occasionally brightened with red), the intricately detailed art&nbsp;is reminiscent&nbsp;of&nbsp;the time when picture books were rarely full color. In a brief note, Bean explains how he works: extensive drawing, then scanning into his computer, where he recomposes and recolors the images.&nbsp;The almost wordless concluding spreads, which picture father and&nbsp;daughter sharing the pie with their animal friends, exude love.

What is the connection between them? <br><br>This <em>Very Short Introduction</em> provides an introductory account of Stoic philosophy, and tells the story of how ancient Stoicism survived and evolved into the movement we see today. Exploring the roots of the school in the philosophy of fourth century BCE Greece, Brad Inwood examines its basic history and doctrines and its relationship to the thought of Plato, Aristotle and his successors, and the Epicureans. Sketching the history of the school's reception in the western tradition, he argues that, despite the differences between ancient and contemporary Stoics, there is a common core of philosophical insight that unites the modern version not just to Seneca, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius but also to the school's original founders, Zeno, Cleanthes, and Chrysippus. Inwood concludes by considering the place of Stoicism in modern life.<br><br><strong>ABOUT THE SERIES: </strong>The <em>Very Short Introductions</em> series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area.

Pier Giorgio turned from a life of privilege to one devoted to working with the poor, and was a courageous witness of Christian faith and charity to many others.</p><p>Discouraged by his affluent parents from his religious involvement and deep spiritual life, Pier Giorgio secretly ministered to the poor and marginalized, and was a leader of youth whose love of God transformed the lives of all those around him. He died of the polio virus at the age of 24, and the story of his life and death spread throughout Europe, influencing the young Karol Wojtyla, who as Pope John Paul II described Frassati as "a man of the eight beatitudes, a modern youth and great mountaineer who was keenly interested in the problems of culture, sports and social questions, as well as the true values of life."

But few parents and church leaders realize that a child's moral development is set by the age of nine. It is therefore critical to start developing a child's biblical worldview from the very earliest years of life.<br><br>The problem is complex: parents who themselves did not receive early spiritual training leave their children's training to the church. Yet the church often focuses on older children. The answer is for churches to come alongside parents to provide them biblical worldview training, parenting information, and counseling that will equip them to help their children become the spiritually mature church of tomorrow.

Preachers with elaborate charts share their theories about Revelation and other prophetic books of the Bible. &#x201c;Ah, Babylon stands for the United States ,&#x201d; they say.

Gifted scholar and pastor Mark Hitchcock walks you gently through Bible prophecy in an engaging, user-friendly style.

He has written six books, including 101 Answers to the Most Asked Questions about the End Times, The Coming Islamic Invasion of Israel, Is America in Bible Prophecy?, and What on Earth Is Going On? Mark and his wife Cheryl live in Oklahoma with their two sons.<b>Introduction<br><br></b>Inquiring minds want to know what the future holds for this planet: What are the signs that the end is at hand? Is America mentioned in Bible prophecy? What is the Rapture? Who is the Antichrist? What is 666? When will Armageddon occur? Will there be peace in the Middle East? What do we know about life after death?<br><br>The questions are almost endless. Many of them are questions you have probably asked at one time or another or heard someone else ask. I have asked every one of these questions myself.<br><br>My own interest in prophecy really took off in my early twenties when I began to read the book of Daniel in the Old Testament. My heart was filled with questions and a bunch of confusion. That&#x2019;s when I decided that I needed to learn what the Bible teaches about the end times. Here I am, twenty years later, sharing with you the fruit of my odyssey to answer my own questions.<br><br>As I have traveled around speaking at prophecy conferences and spending time with the people at my home church, I have discovered that no matter where I go, people have the same questions about Bible prophecy and the end times. Over the years I have collected and compiled the most frequently asked questions about Bible prophecy and the end times. That&#x2019;s what this book is about.<br><br>Here are two more things that make me qualified to answer tough questions: First, for the last ten years I have been the pastor of Faith Bible Church in Edmond, Oklahoma, where people want to know the bottom line on things. Second, I have two sons (if you&#x2019;re a parent, you&#x2019;ll understand why this qualifies me to answer hard questions).<br><br>This book will focus on answering 101 of the specific, most asked questions that people like you and me have about the end times. Along the way I will hopefully answer your questions about the last days&#x2014;questions about what will happen in the final drama of the ages.<br><br>To make the book more accessible and user-friendly, these questions are organized into eight sections:<br><br>1. General Questions about Prophecy and the End Times;<br>2. Questions about the Rapture;<br>3. Questions about the Antichrist and His Kingdom;<br>4. Questions about the Tribulation;<br>5. Questions about Armageddon;<br>6. Questions about the Second Coming;<br>7. Questions about the one-thousand-year reign of Christ (the Millennium);<br>8. Questions about the Afterlife;<br>9. At the end, there is one final question just for you.<br><br>Before you dive into this book, let me share five personal thoughts with you that I hope will make it a better read. First, I hope you understand that there are many opinions about the end times. In this book I&#x2019;m endeavoring to lay out what I have come to believe, based on rigorous biblical research, about how the final drama of the ages will play out.<br><br>I am fully aware that good Christian brothers and sisters disagree with me on numerous points. That&#x2019;s fine. The only essential that we all must hold on this topic is that Jesus is the one and only Savior from sin who is coming back to earth to judge the living and the dead. However, when writing a book like this, an author has to make some decisions and interpretations. I&#x2019;ll do my best to show you how I reached my conclusions, but I hope you&#x2019;ll feel free to disagree and yet keep reading with an open mind.<br><br>Second, the questions in the book are not listed in the order of how frequently they&#x2019;re asked. The questions are grouped in clusters, with each section laying the groundwork for the next. However, each question can stand alone. So feel free to skip around. Just keep in mind that without some of the foundation in previous answers, you might miss a beat here or there.<br><br>Third, throughout this book I will be using masculine pronouns (he/him/his), but my intent is to include female readers as well unless the context clearly indicates that I am referring to a male.<br><br>Fourth, since there are many references to Scripture sprinkled throughout the book you will get the most out of it if you keep a Bible handy as you read and take a few extra minutes to look up some of the main references. After all, God&#x2019;s Word is our only source of truth for the future.<br><br>Fifth, as you read this book please know that I have already prayed and asked the Lord to use this book in your life, to answer your questions about the end times, to give you a greater interest in the study of Bible prophecy, and to draw you closer to our wonderful Savior who is the ultimate subject of all prophecy and the final answer to all our deepest questions.<br><br>&#x201c;<i>The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy</i>.&#x201d;<br>REVELATION 19:10<br>SECTION ONE<br><br><b>General Questions about Prophecy and the End Times<br><br></b><i>It&#x2019;s very difficult to prophesy, especially about the future.<br></i>CHINESE PROVERB<br><br>Only one generation in three has a chance to witness the end of a century. Rarer still, only one generation in thirty gets to see the end of a millennium. We have been privileged to experience the transition from the end of one millennium to the beginning of a new one.

What does the Bible tell us will happen in the end times? Is there a scriptural blueprint that shows us where the world is headed?<br><br>The purpose of this section is to provide an overview of what the Bible reveals about the last days.

Can it center on people and what really matters to them day-in and day-out. And help us understand their hidden motives for why they do what they do in everyday life?<br><br>Uri Gneezy and John List are revolutionaries. Their ideas and methods for revealing what really works in addressing big social, business, and economic problems gives us new understanding of the motives underlying human behavior. We can then structure incentives that can get people to move mountains, change their behavior or at least get a better deal.<br><br>But finding the right incentive can be like looking for a needle in a haystack. Gneezy and List's pioneering approach is to embed themselves in the factories, schools, communities, and offices where people work, live, and play. Then, through large-scale field experiments conducted in the wild,&#x201d; Gneezy and List observe people in their natural environments without them being aware that they are observed.<br><br>Their randomized experiments have revealed ways to close the gap between rich and poor students; to stop the violence plaguing inner-city schools; to decipher whether women are really less competitive than men; to correctly price products and services; and to discover the real reasons why people discriminate.<br><br>To get the answers, Gneezy and List boarded planes, helicopters, trains, and automobiles to embark on journeys from the foothills of Kilimanjaro to California wineries; from sultry northern India to the chilly streets of Chicago; from the playgrounds of schools in Israel to the boardrooms of some of the world's largest corporations. In The Why Axis, they take us along for the ride, and through engaging and colorful stories, present lessons with big payoffs.<br><br>Their revelatory, startling, and urgent discoveries about how incentives really work are both revolutionary and immensely practical. This research will change both the way we think about and take action on big and little problems. Instead of relying on assumptions, we can find out, through evidence, what really works. Anyone working in business, politics, education, or philanthropy can use the approach Gneezy and List describe in The Why Axis to reach a deeper, nuanced understanding of human behavior, and a better understanding of what motivates people and why.<br></p><p><b>Uri Gneezy</b> was born and raised in Israel, where he learned applied game theory firsthand in the streets of Tel Aviv.

The canny, lovable old Scotsman carelessly tossed it into my mind, when I was but a boy. Then he sat back in his chair, with a merry twinkle in his eyes, and watched carefully to see if I had brains enough to understand the full significance of what he had said to me. <br>&nbsp;<br>When he saw that I had grasped the idea, he asked if I would be willing to spend twenty years or more, preparing myself to take it to the world, to men and women who, without the secret, might go through life as failures. I said I would, and with Mr. Carnegie&#x2019;s cooperation, I have kept my promise.<br>&nbsp;<br>This book contains the secret, after having been put to a practical test by thousands of people, in almost every walk of life. It was Mr. Carnegie&#x2019;s idea that the magic formula, which gave him a stupendous fortune, ought to be placed within reach of people who do not have time to investigate how men make money, and it was his &nbsp;hope that I might test and demonstrate the soundness of the formula through the experience of men and women in every calling. He believed the formula should be taught in all public schools and colleges, and expressed the opinion that if it were properly taught it would so revolutionize the entire educational system that the time spent in school could be reduced to less than half.<br>&nbsp;<br>His experience with Charles M. Schwab, and other young men of Mr. Schwab&#x2019;s type, convinced Mr. Carnegie that much of that which is taught in the schools is of no value whatsoever in connection with the business of earning a living or accumulating riches. He had arrived at this decision, because he had taken into his business one young man after another, many of them with but little schooling, and by coaching them in the use of this formula, developed in them rare leadership. Moreover, <i>his coaching made fortunes for everyone of them who followed his instructions.</i><br>&nbsp;<br>In the chapter on Faith, you will read the astounding story of the organization of the giant United States Steel Corporation, as it was conceived and carried out by one of the young men through whom Mr. Carnegie proved that his formula will work <i>for all who are ready for it. </i>This single application of the secret, by that young man&#x2014; Charles M. Schwab&#x2014; made him a huge fortune in both money and OPPORTUNITY. Roughly speaking, this particular application of the formula was worth <i>six hundred million dollars.</i><br>&nbsp;<br>These facts&#x2014; and they are facts well known to almost everyone who knew Mr. Carnegie&#x2014; give you a fair idea of what the reading of this book may bring to you, provided you <i>KNOW WHAT IT IS THAT YOU WANT. </i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br>Even before it had undergone twenty years of practical testing, the secret was passed on to more than one hundred thousand men and women who have used it for their personal benefit, as Mr. Carnegie planned that they should. Some have made fortunes with it. Others have used it successfully in creating harmony in their homes. <br>&nbsp;<br>A clergyman used it so effectively that it brought him an income of upwards of $75,000.00 a year. <br>Arthur Nash, a Cincinnati tailor, used his near-bankrupt business as a &#x201c;guinea pig&#x201d; on which to test the formula. The business came to life and made a fortune for its owners. It is still thriving, although Mr. Nash has gone. <br>&nbsp;<br>The experiment was so unique that newspapers and magazines, gave it more than a million dollars&#x2019; worth of laudatory publicity. <br>&nbsp;<br>The secret was passed on to Stuart Austin Wier, of Dallas, Texas. He was ready for it&#x2014;so ready that he gave up his profession and studied law. Did he succeed? That story is told too. I gave the secret to Jennings Randolph, the day he graduated from College, and he has used it so successfully that he is now serving his third term as a Member of Congress, with an excellent opportunity to keep on using it until it carries him to the White House. <br>&nbsp;<br>While serving as Advertising Manager of the LaSalle Extension University, when it was little more than a name, I had the privilege of seeing J. G. Chapline, President of the University, use the formula so effectively that he has since made the La-Salle one of the great extension schools of the country.<br>&nbsp;<br>The secret to which I refer has been mentioned no fewer than a hundred times, throughout this book. It has not been directly named, for it seems to work more successfully when it is merely uncovered and left in sight, where THOSE WHO ARE READY, and SEARCHING FOR IT, may pick it up. That is why Mr. Carnegie tossed it to me so quietly, without giving me its specific name. <br>&nbsp;<br>If you are READY to put it to use, you will recognize this secret at least once in every chapter. I wish I might feel privileged to tell you how you will know if you are ready, but that would deprive you of much of the benefit you will receive when you make the discovery in your own way.<br>&nbsp;<br>While this book was being written, my own son, who was then finishing the last year of his college work, picked up the manuscript of chapter two, read it, and discovered the secret for himself. He used the information so effectively that he went directly into a responsible position at a beginning salary greater than the average man ever earns. His story has been briefly described in chapter two. When you read it, perhaps you will dismiss any feeling you may have had, at the beginning of the book, that it promised too much. And, too, if you have ever been discouraged, if you have had difficulties to surmount which took the very soul out of you, if you have tried and failed, if you were ever handicapped by illness or physical affliction, this story of my son&#x2019;s discovery and use of the Carnegie formula may prove to be the oasis in the Desert of Lost Hope, for which you have been searching.<br>&nbsp;<br>This secret was extensively used by President Woodrow Wilson, during the World War. It was passed on to every soldier who fought in the war, carefully wrapped in the training received before going to the front. President Wilson told me it was a strong factor in raising the funds needed for the war.<br>&nbsp;<br>Early in the 20th century, Manuel L. Quezon (then Resident Commissioner of the Philippine Islands), was inspired by the secret to gain freedom for his people. He has gained freedom for the Philippines, and is the first President of the free state.<br>&nbsp;<br>A peculiar thing about this secret is that those who once acquire it and use it, find themselves literally swept on to success, with but little effort, and they never again submit to failure! If you doubt this, study the names of those who have used it, wherever they have been mentioned, check their records for yourself, and be convinced.<br>There is no such thing as SOMETHING FOR NOTHING!<br>&nbsp;<br>The secret to which I refer cannot be had without a price, although the price is far less than its value. It cannot be had at any price by those who are not intentionally searching for it. It cannot be given away, it cannot be purchased for money, for the reason that it comes in two parts. One part is already in possession of those who are ready for it. <br>&nbsp;<br>The secret serves equally well, all who are ready for it. Education has nothing to do with it. Long before I was born, the secret had found its way into the possession of Thomas A. Edison, and he used it so intelligently that he became the world&#x2019;s leading inventor, although he had but three months of schooling.<br>&nbsp;<br>The secret was passed on to a business associate of Mr. Edison. He used it so effectively that, although he was then making only $12,000 a year, he accumulated a great fortune, and retired from active business while still a young man. You will find his story at the beginning of the first chapter. It should convince you that riches are not beyond your reach, that you can still be what you wish to be, that money, fame, recognition and happiness can be had by all who are ready and determined to have these blessings.<br>&nbsp;<br>How do I know these things? You should have the answer before you finish this book. You may find it in the very first chapter, or on the last page.<br>&nbsp;<br>While I was performing the twenty year task of research, which I had undertaken at Mr. Carnegie&#x2019;s request, I analyzed hundreds of well known men, many of whom admitted that they had accumulated their vast fortunes through the aid of the Carnegie secret; among these men were:<br>&nbsp;<br>HENRY FORD<br>WILLIAM WRIGLEY JR.<br>JOHN WANAMAKER<br>JAMES J. HILL<br>GEORGE EASTMAN<br>THEODORE ROOSEVELT JR.<br>WILBUR WRIGHT<br>WILLIAM JENNINGS BRYAN<br>KING GILLETTE<br>JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER<br>THOMAS A. EDISON<br>F. W. WOOLWORTH<br>WOODROW WILSON<br>WILLIAM HOWARD TAFT<br>DR. ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL<br>CLARENCE DARROW<br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>These names represent but a small fraction of the hundreds of well known Americans whose achievements, financially and otherwise, prove that those who understand and apply the Carnegie secret, reach high stations in life. I have never known anyone who was inspired to use the secret, who did not achieve noteworthy success in his chosen calling. I have never known any person to distinguish himself, or to accumulate riches of any consequence, without possession of the secret.&nbsp; From these two facts I draw the conclusion that the secret is more important, as a part of the knowledge essential for self-determination, than any which one receives through what is popularly known as &#x201c;education.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>What is EDUCATION, anyway? This has been answered in full detail. As far as schooling is concerned, many of these men had very little. John Wanamaker once told me that what little schooling he had, he acquired in very much the same manner as a modern locomotive takes on water, by &#x201c;scooping it up as it runs.&#x201d; Henry Ford never reached high school, let alone college. I am not attempting to minimize the value of schooling, but I am trying to express my earnest belief that those who master and apply the secret will reach high stations, accumulate riches, and bargain with life on their own terms, even if their schooling has been meager.<br>&nbsp;<br>Somewhere, as you read, the secret to which I refer will jump from the page and stand boldly before you, IF YOU ARE READY FOR IT! When it appears, you will recognize it. Whether you receive the sign in the first or the last chapter, stop for a moment when it presents itself, and raise your glass to toast your epiphany. <br>&nbsp;<br>Chapter One tells the story of my very dear friend, who has generously acknowledged having seen the mystic sign, and whose business achievements are evidence enough that he turned down a glass. As you read his story, and the others, remember that they deal with the important problems of life, such as all men experience. The problems arising from one&#x2019;s endeavor to earn a living, to find hope, courage, contentment and peace of mind; to accumulate riches and to enjoy freedom of body and spirit.<br>&nbsp;<br>Remember, too, as you go through the book, that it deals with facts and not with fiction, its purpose being to convey a great universal truth through which all who are READY may learn, not only <i>WHAT </i>TO DO, BUT ALSO <i>HOW </i>TO DO IT! and receive, as well, THE NEEDED STIMULUS TO MAKE A START. <br>&nbsp;<br>As a final word of preparation, before you begin the first chapter, may I offer one brief suggestion which may provide a clue by which the Carnegie secret may be recognized? It is this&#x2014;<i>ALL ACHIEVEMENT, ALL EARNED RICHES, HAVE THEIR BEGINNING IN AN IDEA! </i>If you are ready for the secret, you already possess one half of it, therefore, you will readily recognize the other half the moment it reaches your mind. <br>&nbsp;<br>Napoleon Hill, 1937</p><h2>New American Bible/No. 611/22</h2><p><em>This bible is a large print edition and the Font size is <strong>10 pt</strong>.</em></p><p></p><h2>Get Strong: The Ultimate 16-Week Transformation Program For gaining Muscle And Strength&#x2015;Using The Power Of Progressive Calisthenics</h2><p><p><b>How to Build a Better Body Fast</b></p><p>Where do you belong on the strength continuum?

Visit him at&nbsp;chrisvanallsburg.com.&nbsp;</p>[Signature]<i>Reviewed by</i> Jim McMullanThe magic in Van Allsburg's new book <i>Probuditi!</i> has been domesticated. Instead of supernatural powers sending rhinos charging through the living room, as in <i>Jumanji</i>, or spacemen falling through the ceiling, as in <i>Zathura</i>, Calvin, the protagonist of <i>Probuditi!</i>, employs a simple magician's trick to set the story in motion.Calvin and his buddy Rodney attend a performance by Lomax the Magnificent where the magician, by means of a rotating spiral disc, hypnotizes a woman and convinces her that she is a chicken. At the end of the show, Lomax says, "Probuditi!" and the woman snaps out of her trance. Inspired, Calvin makes his own rotating disc and manages to hypnotize his sister, Trudy, into thinking that she's a dog. Calvin and Rodney thoroughly enjoy Trudy's canine antics until they realize that Calvin's mom will soon be home, and they can't remember the magic word to reverse the spell. After several frantic dehypnotizing tries, it all works out with a little quiet help from Trudy.Although I miss the sense of otherworldly beauty that Van Allsburg achieved in some of his earlier books, particularly <i>The Wreck of the Zephyr</i>, the vaudevillian spirit of <i>Probuditi!</i> gives the artist a chance to make some very funny pictures. The lady Lomax hypnotizes struts around an imaginary barnyard like a crazed hen who happens to be wearing pearls and high heels. Trudy laps water from a bowl on the floor with almost embarrassing relish, and squats expectantly like a goofy golden retriever. All the characters and the scenes they inhabit seem to come from some iconic 1940s smalltown childhood, which is made all the more nostalgic by the artist wrapping them in a haze of luminosity. This typical "Van Allsburg light" is so effective in the way that it leavens the painstaking solidity of his illustrations and connects the details in a convincing atmosphere. So even though he is not using his light to bathe the classic simplicity of a sailboat floating through the sky, the light in these pictures still works to create the glow that we have come to expect in a Van Allsburg book and to give this homespun tale the quality of a remembered dream.The story of <i>Probuditi!</i> may not involve spacemen or exotic transformations, but it's still about the lure of magic and, this time, it's a magic that maybe any kid can make with a spiral disc and a gullible friend.

The Revolution proved that the masses could not only overthrow autocratic governments, but also form an opposing government in their own image. The new idea that the working class and the peasantry could be allied, combined with the clear strength and necessity of a vanguard party, guided multiplying revolutions across the globe. This book explains the ideological power of the October Revolution in the Global South. From Ho Ch� Minh&nbsp;to Fidel Castro, to reflections on polycentric Communism and collective memories of Communism, it shows how, for a brief moment, another world was possible. It is not a comprehensive study, but a small book with a large hope &#x2013; that a new generation will come to see the importance of this revolutionary spirit for the working class and peasantry in the parts of the world that suffered under the heel of colonial domination for centuries.</p><p><b>Vijay Prashad</b> is the executive director of Tricontinental: Institute for Social Research.

C. Zain is the pen name used by Elbert Benjamine(1882-1951), the noted astrologer, naturalist and occultist, for those writings done under the aegis of The Brotherhood of Light during the years 1914 - 1934. This body of knowledge, referred to interchangeably as The Brotherhood of Light Lessons or The Religion of the Stars, was envisioned by Zain to be a world religion of the future. The mission of Zain s writing is centered on a nine-point plan to insure the citizens of the world Freedom from Want, Freedom from Fear, Freedom of Expression, and Freedom of Religion. To obtain these freedoms he encourages the individual to become familiar with the Facts of Astrology, the Facts of Extra-Sensory Perception, the Facts of Induced Emotion and the Facts of Directed Thinking. The moral code is Contribute Your Utmost to Universal Welfare. Within the first half of the 20th century B. of L. teachings were distributed around the world. Like the writings of Bailey, Blavatsky, Steiner, and Heindl, the works of C. C. Zain have impacted the lives of thousands of students of Western Occultism. <br> Elbert Benjamine, was born Benjamin P. Williams in the small town of Adel, Iowa, December 12, 1882. His family remembered his birth because it was the year a comet flashed across the sky. His father was a doctor and a deacon in the Disciples of Christ Church. His interests in occultism and astrology were frowned upon in his community. He changed his name to Elbert Benjamine upon moving to Los Angeles in order to protect his family. <br> Benjamine s desire was to be a naturalist. As a boy he spent every free hour in the woods observing the habits of wild things, an enthusiasm that would continue his entire life. He later held the position of president of the Southern California Nature Club for 25 years and was responsible for the establishment of a bird sanctuary in Los Angeles. Benjamine contacted the Brotherhood of Light in the spring of 1909 and was commissioned to place the teachings in writing. <br>In his day Elbert Benjamine was a unique leader. He opposed hero worship and cult-like behavior. He discouraged members from taking any of his writings on blind belief. Instead he encouraged them to subject them to rigorous testing of their own. Church of Light members are given freedom of conscience and encouraged to study as many things about religion, science and the mysteries as they can and then draw their own conclusions.</p><h2>Amadeus: A Play by Peter Shaffer</h2><p><p>0riginating at the National Theatre of Great Britain, <em>Amadeus</em> was the recipient of both the Evening Standard Drama Award and the Theatre Critics Award.

As recounted by a local observer, Potter seems to have a latex thumb and has raised balloons in all sizes and shapes, in colors like "Pleasin' Purple," "Orange-Ray Sun" and "Jelly-Bean Black." Such spectacle naturally piques the curiosity of townsfolk and prompts the female narrator to perform a secret investigation of Harvey's planting methods. Perched in a tree one night, she witnesses a sort of dancing ritual that Harvey performs with a magic "conjure stick," and her life is changed forever. Debut author Nolen's full-bodied text is peppered with shades of a Southern dialect and has the cozy feel of a back porch storytelling session. Her fiercely independent characters add even more pizzazz. Buehner's ( The Adventures of Taxi Dog ) rich acrylics are chock-full of zippy colors.

At this point, most of us experience one overwhelming reaction&#x2014;fear&#x2014;and this fear can have negative physical, mental, and emotional consequences on how well we do our job. <br><br>Don Greene, Ph.D., renowned sports psychologist, professor at the Juilliard School, and "stress" coach to top executives, has spent decades studying fear, and in this groundbreaking book, he identifies seven essential skills required to fight fear and perform at your best: Determination, Energy, Perspective, Courage, Focus, Poise, and Resilience. <br><br>Whether you are giving a closing argument in a courtroom, making a presentation at work, or stepping up to the first tee, this simple twenty-one-day plan will make a profound difference in the way you approach challenges, allowing you to think more clearly and creatively under pressure. <i>Fight Your Fear and Win</i> is the ultimate tool for conquering your fear and achieving success when you need it most.</p><p>Renowned performance coach Don Greene, Ph.D., leads readers on a strategic, goal-reaching mission in this compact, powerful, and often fascinating handbook. A former Airborne Ranger and Green Beret (among a long list of other impressive credentials), Greene believes fear is only conquered by action--not by lying on a therapist's couch. To that end, he urges readers to assess their current skills (by taking a relatively simple survey provided in the book), pinpoint their weaker performance tendencies, then "embark on a training regimen" to flex seven specific fear-conquering muscles: determination, energy, perspective, courage, focus, poise, and resilience. <p> Greene uses each chapter to tell a story or two about a client--ranging from Olympic athletes to professional musicians to SWAT teams--whose fear scenarios provide a steppingstone for analyzing the seven skills mentioned above (determination, etc). He then quite eloquently describes how fear attempts to thwart each particular skill, and offers clear methods for retaliating ("centering down" to counteract ineffective nervous energy, or using anger constructively to develop resilience). The eight appendices outline his three-week prescription for mastering each skill, plus the key for scoring the skills survey. While his occasional military references and sports analogies offer glimpses into his commando training and sports psychology background, Greene never comes off as a stony General nor as a hyped cheerleader. Rather, his graceful writing style is rich with humor, candor, and valuable information. Forgivably cocky at times ("Nobody in the world has done as much as I have to bring out people's best"), Greene simply knows his stuff and--to the reader's benefit--presents it beautifully. <i>--Liane Thomas</i></p>Praise for Don Greene&#x2019;s <b>Fight Your Fear and Win</b> Program:<br><br>&#x201c;Ask and a teacher appears.

In 1979, Pope John Paul II departed from this traditional dichotomy and offered an integrated vision of the human body and soul.

(RT, 8). This wonder, we went on to see, is called forth by the richness of our experience of life-especially by the experience of love. Our task now is to ponder the indispensable role the body plays in this many-faceted experience of wonder.<br>Experience and Meaning<br>We all face the temptation to let life's current carry us along-to "go with the flow" without any resistance. But if we simply let a flood of experiences wash over us, we are in danger of losing the meaning of our lives. A recent survey of teenagers in Southampton, United Kingdom, revealed that this danger is anything but purely theoretical. The respondents, it turned out, possessed only a limited vocabulary to express the emotional quality of their response to the world. These teens suffered from what has been called "affective illiteracy": the inability to grasp and express the meaning of the experiences generated in us by our encounter with the world around us.<br>&nbsp;<br>It isn't enough, then, simply to let our experiences wash over us. We need to plumb their depth. This exploration isn't a matter of "sampling" as many possibilities as we can, or of ratcheting up the volume of our existence, but requires us to ask ourselves questions such as these: Are we capable of distinguishing between experiences that build up our happiness and experiences that tear it down? Are we able to discern in our experiences something like a compass for our life's journey? In a word: Are we capable of perceiving the meaning of our experiences? <br>We tend to put experience and meaning in separate boxes. We have already seen why this won't work. When man experiences the world, he necessarily experiences himself in the process. For the same reason, man's experience of the world always involves an at least minimal search for the meaning of his life. The sight of a majestic mountainscape doesn't just reveal the wonder of creation; it also affords us an opportunity to lay hold of our innate capacity for beauty and wonder. Since the question of man emerges from our contact with the world, experience always goes together with a search for meaning. Even the refusal to embark on this search is an answer to the question of meaning. <br>We had the experience, we missed the meaning <br>And approach to the meaning restores the experience <br>In a different form. <br>These lines from T. S. Eliot's poem "The Dry Salvages" underscore the point that meaning is not foreign to experience. Quite the contrary, meaning is an integral part of experience. So much so, in fact, that meaning makes our experience properly human in the first place. John Paul II's insight into this unity of meaning and experience guided his reflection on the theology of the body, which begins with an effort to recollect the authentic "feel" of man's experience in light of its deepest meaning. In a word, the pope guides us through the labyrinth of our lives using the golden thread of what he calls "original experiences." So what is an "original experience"?<br>The Original Experience<br>John Paul II invites us to seek the true depth of our experience. Actually, it is Christ himself who first entrusted this task to us. When the Pharisees asked him, "Is it lawful to divorce one's wife for any cause?" (Matt. 19:3), he didn't list minimum sufficient grounds for divorce, but went instead to the heart of the matter: Is it really possible to love another person forever? The Pharisees clearly assumed that the answer was no. This assumption reflects their (and our) hardness of heart, and it speaks volumes about man's alienation from the root of his experience of love. <br>Christ came to retrieve and fulfill this root of love, and he therefore replies to the Pharisees by telling them to reread the creation accounts in the book of Genesis. He thus invites his questioners to recover the depth of their experience in the mirror of God's original intention for human love. John Paul II takes Christ at his word. As we know, Genesis presents two different accounts of creation, and John Paul II devotes considerable attention to both. Let's start with his reflections on the first narrative (Gen. 1:1-2:3), which lights up the true shape of our experience of everyday life in the blaze of God's Word. <br>The biblical text unfurls the rich tapestry of creation with all of its color and variety. It places man at the summit of the whole created world and underscores his special privilege of being made in the image and likeness of God. The words "image and likeness" signal the overture to the covenant between God and man in the Bible. They tell us that from the beginning man is the one to whom God addresses his Word and whose special status lies in his capacity to answer this divine call. <br>The Bible's affirmation of man's dignity as the "image and likeness of God," which comes at the end of the first creation account, calls for further commentary, because it still leaves open how man is meant to respond to the Creator. Answering this question is the job that falls to the second creation story (Gen. 2:4-3:24), which can thus be seen as the natural continuation of the first. After we've listened to the creative voice of God in the first account, we perceive man's answering voice in the second. The second creation narrative enables us to rediscover the inner experience through which we are to respond to the Creator's call. <br>In other words, the second creation account shifts the point of view of the story: Now it's man who speaks and reveals his interior world. This account doesn't just observe man from the outside; it presents the human journey of wonderment from man's own point of view. By putting us in man's shoes as he was in the beginning, the second creation account unfolds the "original experiences" we spoke of just now. John Paul II sums up these experiences under the three headings of "original solitude," "original unity," and "original nakedness." <br>Before going on to describe these original experiences, though, we should stop to ask ourselves whether we really can describe them, or even have any access to them at all. How can anyone retrieve events that supposedly took place at the very dawn of history? Even if we could do so, we would still face a further difficulty: Aren't the original experiences John Paul II describes permeated by a purity and innocence sin has extinguished in our hearts? How can experiences belonging to a sunken past help us attain happiness here and now? <br>Fortunately, man's original experiences of the beginning have in fact never been totally lost. Two images help illustrate the abiding presence of the beginning in the midst of our everyday reality. <br>The first image comes from J. R. R. Tolkien's The Silmarillion, which opens with a "creation myth" that compares God's creative design to a piece of music.&nbsp; As Tolkien goes on to relate, Melkor, the dark angel, becomes jealous of God's creative power and tries to introduce a discordant note of his own into the celestial orchestra. Yet, as God reminds Melkor, even this disharmony cannot destroy the pattern of the original music. On the contrary, even Melkor's rebellion will be woven (against his intention) into the final master theme all creation will sing to God's glory. <br>Similarly, we can compare the three original experiences John Paul II refers to with a primordial music that, while distorted through sin, has never completely been destroyed by it. If we listen inattentively, we will hear only noise. If, however, we keep silent and turn our ear to the hidden pattern beneath the noise, we can still discern the original melody that reflects the Creator's wise design. Actually, it's only because the original harmony still resonates in the background that we can hear the dissonance as the disruption it is. <br>Another way of putting this is that the original experiences are not "original" only in the sense that they happened at the beginning of human history. We call the original experiences "original" because they lie at the basis of every other experience and provide the theme for every other music we compose with our lives. Our use of "original," then, has the same double meaning as the Greek word arch&#x17d;, which signifies both a temporal beginning and the foundations of a building. This leads us to the second image that illustrates the continuing accessibility of man's original experiences. <br>As the facade of Saint Peter's Basilica was being cleaned recently in preparation for the Jubilee of the year 2000, the workers were surprised by the green color of the marble surrounding the central windows. Some even thought that the chemical agents used to clean the building were destroying the marble's original color. Consultation of the original plans for the basilica, however, brought to light that this green was indeed the true color of the stone. It's just that it had been covered in grime for so long that no one could recollect its original appearance. <br>A similar grime builds up over our attitude toward life. As children, we live close to the original experiences of Adam and Eve, but as we grow up their freshness is progressively polluted by layers of routine and mechanization. The French philosopher Gabriel Marcel once said that we are the bureaucrats of our own existence, who have buried our original contact with life under mountains of paperwork and procedures that impair our capacity to discern the human drama lying beneath them.&nbsp; <br>If Marcel is right, then the child is closer to man's original experiences, but the adult has almost forgotten them (but not quite). Since the original experiences hover as a vague memory on the borders of our adult awareness, the effort to recover them demands something like a retrieval and healing of these almost obliterated childhood memories. This doesn't mean that we should turn our back on adulthood. Rather our task is to integrate the child's primal contact with life into our adult consciousness. This retrieval unlocks the deep meaning of Jesus's command: "Unless you turn and become like children, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven" (see Matt. 18:3). <br>Of course, only the encounter with Christ enables a total recovery of our original experiences. By the same logic, since the Church preserves the living memory of Christ's presence, it is she who also keeps alive the memory of the beginning. As John Paul II wrote in his last book, Memory and Identity: <br>What is at issue here is not only the mystery of Christ. In him, it is the mystery of man that is revealed from the beginning. There is probably no other text on the origins of man so simple and yet so complete as that contained in the first three chapters of the Book of Genesis. Here not only do we find an account of the creation of man as male and female, but his particular vocation in the universe is made abundantly clear... The Church preserves within herself the memory of man's history from the beginning: the memory of his creation, his vocation, his elevation, and his fall. Within this essential framework the whole of human history, the history of Redemption, is written. The Church is a mother who, like Mary, treasures in her heart the story of her children, making all their problems her own. <br>John Paul II invites us, then, on a quest for the original experiences that make sense out of our lives and point man toward his true fulfillment. He calls us to accompany Adam in his search for his identity, for Adam's search is ours, too. The reader should bear in mind that we will be using the name "Adam" in three different ways in the rest of this book. First of all, "Adam" means man in the inclusive sense of "human being"; "Adam" in this first generally accepted meaning refers to every member of the human race, whether man or woman. Second, "Adam" sometimes refers explicitly to the male, whereas "Eve" stands for the female. Whenever we use the name "Adam" in this second sense, we will try to make it clear that he cannot be understood apart from the woman who, while different from him, is his equal in dignity. Third, "Adam" is a character in several of Karol Wojtyla's plays. Which of these three meanings "Adam" has at any given point in the discussion should be clear from the context. <br>Original Solitude <br>John Paul II's Roman Triptych describes man's search for meaning that begins with the experience of wonder. This search is a journey to the Source: <br>If you want to find the source, <br>you have to go up, against the current. <br>Break through, search, don't yield, <br>you know it must be here somewhere. <br>Where are you?... Source, where are you?! (RT, 9) <br>Having grasped this point, we are ready to turn to the second creation account in the book of Genesis, which retrieves the deepest meaning of human experience in the light of man's relation to this Source, whose freshness John Paul II invites us to taste with our own lips. <br>The Bible relates that God forms Adam from the clay of the ground, imparts to him the breath of life, and then says: "It is not good that the man should be alone" (Gen. 2:18). According to Genesis, then, Edenic man, though surrounded by every kind of plant and animal, felt alone. Adam experienced what John Paul II calls "original solitude." <br>Original solitude doesn't just mean that Adam lacked Eve. Original solitude is not a mere deficit that is subsequently filled out by the creation of the woman. For John Paul II, the experience of original solitude remains even after Eve's appearance in the Garden. Original solitude is an essential experience of the human being, both male and female; it remains at the root of every other human experience and so accompanies man throughout his whole life's journey. Let's look more closely at how original solitude shapes human existence. <br>The term "original solitude" underscores man's uniqueness when compared with the other kinds of beings that surround him, which do not belong to the same order of magnitude as he does. Original solitude is thus another way of expressing man's special dignity, which rests on the basis of his unique privilege of being fashioned in the image and likeness of God as his partner in a dialogue of love. Man is the only living being on earth whom God addresses as a father addresses his son. In a word, original solitude is man's special relationship with his Creator. <br>John Paul II explores this aspect of original solitude in Roman Triptych. For man, the pope writes, "it is not enough to exist and go his way." Why not? Because man is "alone in his wonderment, among many beings incapable of wonder" (RT, 8). The wonderment that prompts man to seek his own identity is both a discovery and an expression of his original solitude before God. In the words of Saint Augustine: "You have made us for yourself, and our heart is restless until it rests in you." <br>According to the biblical account, God molds Adam out of the dust of the ground and places him in the middle of the Garden of Eden, where there is abundant water and vegetation-tokens of God's care for his creature. These images vividly illustrate man's solidarity with the material creation. Scripture uses the term "flesh" (in He...</p><h2>Fighter in Velvet Gloves: Alaska Civil Rights Hero Elizabeth Peratrovich</h2><p>&#x201c;No Natives or Dogs Allowed,&#x201d; blared the storefront sign at Elizabeth Peratrovich, then a young Alaska Native Tlingit.

In <i>Speaking in Bones,</i> the forensic anthropologist finds herself drawn into a world of dark secrets and dangerous beliefs, where good and evil blur.<br> &nbsp;<br> Professionally, Temperance Brennan knows exactly what to do&#x2014;test, analyze, identify. Her personal life is another story. She&#x2019;s at a loss, wondering how to answer police detective Andrew Ryan&#x2019;s marriage proposal. But the matter of matrimony takes a backseat when murder rears its head.<br> &nbsp;<br> Hazel &#x201c;Lucky&#x201d; Strike&#x2014;a strident amateur detective who mines the Internet for cold cases&#x2014;comes to Brennan with a tape recording of an unknown girl being held prisoner and terrorized.

Strike is also certain that the teenager&#x2019;s remains are gathering dust in Temperance Brennan&#x2019;s lab.<br> &nbsp;<br> Brennan has doubts about working with a self-styled websleuth. But when the evidence seems to add up, Brennan&#x2019;s next stop is the treacherous backwoods where the chilling recording (and maybe Cora Teague&#x2019;s bones) were discovered. Her forensic field trip only turns up more disturbing questions&#x2014;along with gruesome proof of more untimely deaths.<br> &nbsp;<br> While local legends of eerie nocturnal phenomena and sinister satanic cults abound, it&#x2019;s a zealous and secretive religious sect that has Brennan spooked and struggling to separate the saints from the sinners. But there&#x2019;s nothing, including fire and brimstone, that can distract her from digging up the truth and taking down a killer&#x2014;even as Brennan finds herself in a place where angels fear to tread, devils demand their due, and she may be damned no matter what.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Speaking in Bones</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;<i>Speaking in Bones</i> keeps the suspense high.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Associated Press</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> &#x201c;Temperance&#x2019;s forensic sleuthing uncovers many secrets, along with a blockbuster psychological surprise.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>The Huffington Post</i></b></p><p><b>Kathy Reichs </b>is the author of nineteen <i>New York Times</i> bestselling novels and the co-author, with her son, Brendan Reichs, of six novels for young adults.

This authoritative book, now revised and updated, has given tens of thousands of professionals and students a state-of-the-art framework for understanding the journey both into and out of addiction. From Carlo C. DiClemente, codeveloper of the transtheoretical model (TTM), the book identifies the stages and processes involved in initiating, modifying, maintaining, or stopping any pattern of behavior. Grounded in extensive research, and illustrated with vivid case examples, the book shows how using the TTM can help overcome obstacles to change and make treatment and prevention more effective.<br> &nbsp;<br> New to This Edition<br> *Incorporates 15 years of research advances, contemporary prevention and treatment approaches, and the ongoing development of the TTM.<br> *Chapter on current developments in intervention research.<br> *Expanded discussions of neuroscience; self-regulation; behavioral economics; self-help, mutual help, and spirituality; motivational issues; "process addictions" (gambling and sex addiction); and more.<br> *Deeper coverage of risk and protective factors across adolescent and young adult development.&nbsp;</p><p>Carlo C. DiClemente, PhD, ABPP, is Professor Emeritus of Psychology at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), and Director of the MDQuit tobacco resource center, the Center for Community Collaboration, and the Home Visitor Training Certificate Program at UMBC. He is codeveloper of the transtheoretical model of behavior change and author of numerous scientific publications on motivation and behavior change with a variety of health and addictive behaviors. His books include <i>Addiction and Change, Second Edition</i>; <i>Substance Abuse Treatment and the Stages of Change, Second Edition</i>; <i>Group Treatment for Substance Abuse, Second Edition</i>; and the self-help resource<i> Changing for Good</i>. Dr. DiClemente is a recipient of awards including the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Addictive Behaviors Special Interest Group of the Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies, the John P. McGovern Award from the American Society of Addiction Medicine, the Innovators Combating Substance Abuse award from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and a Presidential Citation from the American Psychological Association."This masterful book provides an overall framework for understanding how people take up addictions and how they move away from them. The second edition organizes a wealth of recent research about prevention, treatments, and biological and social influences. It puts knowledge about every aspect of psychosocial treatments for addictions at the reader's fingertips, and includes interesting, relevant case studies. DiClemente is an excellent writer with a relaxed and engaging style and a passion for his subject. This is an invaluable resource for college courses on addictions--I can't wait to use it in my classes."--Theresa B. Moyers, PhD, Department of Psychology, University of New Mexico<br><br> "<i>Addiction and Change, Second Edition,</i> incorporates the considerable body of addiction-related research that has accumulated over the last dozen years. DiClemente presents an important integration of many areas of research and advocates a personalized approach to treatment planning. He emphasizes that achieving and maintaining change is a process, not a product. This book will expand therapists&#x2019; toolboxes while serving as a guide for case conceptualization. Well done!"--Linda Carter Sobell, PhD, ABPP, and Mark B. Sobell, PhD, ABPP, Center for Psychological Studies, Nova Southeastern University<br><br> "The updated second edition attests to the major, expanding influence of the TTM on our understanding and treatment of addictive behavior. Decades of research inspired by the TTM are well reflected here; the book is also replete with references to other approaches and is sprinkled with clinical case examples that illustrate and amplify. Especially highlighted is the broader context of cultural and social factors that affect the processes of change. The author's personal anecdotes and self-reflection add a relevant personal touch to the book, which could easily serve as a text for the large swath of disciplines aiding those on their journey through change."--Peter M. Monti, PhD, Donald G. Millar Distinguished Professor of Alcohol and Addiction Studies and Director, Center for Alcohol and Addiction Studies, Brown University<br><br> "I thoroughly enjoy DiClemente's ability to take complex concepts and translate them into language that therapists and counselors can understand and utilize with their patients. More than most textbooks I use with graduate students, this one gives depth and texture to the idea of 'meeting clients where they are at.' Students and therapists consistently feel that the book helps them individualize treatment strategies and interventions more than any other source. I will definitely assign the second edition in my courses."--Kevin C. Gilliland, PsyD, Adjunct Faculty, Department of Dispute Resolution and Counseling, Southern Methodist University; Executive Director, Innovation 360 Dallas<br><br>"This updated and revised new edition has many advantages....<i>Addiction and Change</i> continues to be an invaluable resource for new students looking for foundational instruction and for seasoned professionals seeking information on recent advances in the field.

The book interacts heavily with the literature on these issues in contemporary analytic metaphysics, so as to facilitate the analytic reader's understanding of Scholastic ideas and the Scholastic reader's understanding of contemporary analytic philosophy.<br><br>The Aristotelian theory of actuality and potentiality provides the organizing theme, and the crucial dependence of Scholastic metaphysics on this theory is demonstrated. The book is written from a Thomistic point of view, but Scotist and Suarezian positions are treated as well where they diverge from the Thomistic position.</p><p>Edward Feser is Associate Professor of Philosophy at Pasadena City College in Pasadena, California, USA. His many books include Scholastic Metaphysics: A Contemporary Introduction, Aquinas, and the edited volume Aristotle on Method and Metaphysics.<p>&#x201c;One would be hard pressed to find a better introduction to scholastic metaphysics than that provided by Edward Feser. The book is excellently organized, treats its various topics with remarkable thoroughness and depth, and is written in an always clear, precise, and vibrant style. The book could only have been written by someone who has a complete command of the fundamental concepts of scholastic metaphysics, as well as an impressive knowledge of the main currents of modern philosophy. . . . For anyone who seeks a substantive and sound introduction to scholastic metaphysics, this is the book with which to begin.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x2014;D. Q. McInerny, <em>The Review of Metaphysics</em></p> <p>&#x201c;This is an excellent little survey of scholastic metaphysics. . . . Highly recommended. Anyone working in metaphysics, the philosophy of nature, or the philosophy of mind would be well advised to read through this book.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x2014;Patrick Toner, <em>American Catholic Philosophical Quarterly</em></p> <p>&#x201c;Feser's new book is a welcome addition for those interested in bringing the concepts, terminology and presuppositions between scholastic and contemporary analytic philosophers to commensuration. In fact, I would contend that Feser's book will constitute an important piece in its own right for guiding the research program for contemporary Thomistic metaphysicians into the future.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x2014;<em>Notre Dame Philosophical Review</em></p> <p>&#x201c;<em>Scholastic Metaphysics </em>is a well written defense of common sense beliefs about the nature of reality itself, and if read carefully, will probably persuade many. Establishing the veracity of this metaphysic entails supporting classical theism, the reality of universals, the efficacy of natural reason, and the normativity of natural law.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x2014;Andrew Fulford, The Calvinist International</p> <p>&#x201c;Edward Feser&#x2019;s latest book gives readers who are familiar with analytic philosophy an excellent overview of scholastic metaphysics in the tradition of Thomas Aquinas. . . . Feser&#x2019;s book contains a wealth of material about the debates in contemporary analytical philosophy. . . . The recovery of scholastic metaphysics depends on the recovery of that understanding of nature and substance that is central to the thought of Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas. . . . In his new book, Edard Feser has taken a key step in this important endeavor.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x2014;William E. Carroll, <em>Public Discourse</em></p> <p>&#x201c;What this book does, and does very well, is give us an insightful introduction to metaphysics. . . . It is one of the most refreshing books I have come across in years. . . . Edward Feser&#x2019;s <em>Scholastic Metaphysics</em> is an ordinary &#x2018;manual&#x2019; that is not ordinary. It is nothing less than a defense of reality, of the capacity of the mind to know what is. It is a book that puts science in the right place because it has the mind in the right place.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x2014;Rev. James V. Schall, S. J., <em>Crisis Magazine</em></p> <p>&#x201c;In his new book, <em>Scholastic Metaphysics: A Contemporary Introduction</em> (Editions Scholasticae, 2014), Edward Feser shows how the Aristotelian-Thomistic metaphysics developed by thinkers who take key ideas from Aristotle and St. Thomas Aquinas is still relevant today. . . . For any readers who seek the thrill of thinking through the most serious intellectual disputes about the fundamental structures of reality, Scholastic Metaphysics delivers the excitement. Feser offers an indispensable philosophical toolkit for any mind that dares to contemplate not only the real truths of modern physics, but also everything that in principle, by nature, lies beyond physics&#x2019; grasp.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x2014;Christopher S. Morrissey, <em>Catholic World Report</em></p> <p>&#x201c;I not only enjoyed the book thoroughly, I wanted more. . . . For those, though, who are philosophically minded, and who want to explore the ideas I&#x2019;ve been discussing in my posts on St. Thomas Aquinas over the last couple months, I recommend it highly.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x2014;Will Duquette, www.patheos.com/blogs/crywoof</p> <p>&#x201c;Feser is a good writer. . . . <em>Scholastic Metaphysics: A Contemporary Introduction</em> was by and large a pleasure to read.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x2014;Michael Sullivan, http://lyfaber.blogspot.com</p> <p>&#x201c;Feser&#x2019;s book is a clearly written and remarkably well-researched analysis of the concept of scholastic metaphysics.

Las Vegas is at its smooth, cool peak. The Strip is a jet-age theme park, and the greatest singer in the history of American popular music summons a group of friends there to make a movie. One is an insouciant singer of Italian songs, ex-partner to the most popular film comedian of the day. One is a short, black, Jewish, one-eyed, singing, dancing wonder. One is an upper-crust British pretty boy turned degenerate B-movie star actor, brother-in-law to an ascendant politician. And one is a stiff-shouldered comic with the quintessential Borscht Belt emcee&#x2019;s knack for needling one-liners. The architectonically sleek marquee of the Sands Hotel announces their presence simply by listing their names: FRANK SINATRA. DEAN MARTIN. SAMMY DAVIS, JR. PETER LAWFORD. JOEY BISHOP. Around them an entire cast gathers: actors, comics, singers, songwriters, gangsters, politicians, and women, as well as thousands of starstruck everyday folks who fork over pocketfuls of money for the privilege of basking in their presence. They call themselves The Clan. But to an awed world, they are known as The Rat Pack.<br><br>They had it all. Fame. Gorgeous women. A fabulouse playground of a city and all the money in the world. The backing of fearsome crime lords and the blessing of the President of the United States. But the dark side&#x2013;over the thin line between pleasure and debauchery, between swinging self-confidence and brutal arrogance&#x2013;took its toll. In four years, their great ride was over, and showbiz was never the same. <br><br>Acclaimed Jerry Lewis biographer Shawn Levy has written a dazzling portrait of a time when neon brightness cast sordid shadows. It was Frank&#x2019;s World, and we just lived in it.</p><p>If you're not inclined to read individual biographies of Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Sammy Davis Jr., Shawn Levy's <i>Rat Pack Confidential</i> is a perfect one-stop resource. Less a group biography than a series of impressionistic snapshots, the book is loaded with can't-miss material--the dirt on the making of <i>Ocean's Eleven</i>, information about Sinatra's wild stint as a casino owner, deep background on Peter Lawford's habit of introducing Jack Kennedy to glamorous starlets, wiretap transcripts of mobsters Sam Giancana and Johnny Formosa discussiong Dean Martin's lack of respect.<p> Levy, whose previous book, <i>King of Comedy</i>, is a serious consideration of Jerry Lewis's life and career, offers similarly well considered insights into the members of the Rat Pack. He covers Davis's lifelong struggle against racism and the complicated intertwinings of the Kennedy political machine and "the Clan," as the performers preferred to be called (they often denied anything like the Rat Pack even existed and resisted collective references). </p><p> The book's debts to its predecessors are often apparent; much of the material on Sinatra's friendship with Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, for example, appears to have been gleaned from recent Bogart biographies. The writing style, which tries to capture the ring-a-ding-ding feel of the era, also owes serious debts to Nick Tosches by way of James Ellroy, while only intermittently reaching their level of mastery. But these are minor quibbles. As a synthesis of thirty years worth of journalism and celebrity biography, <i>Rat Pack Confidential</i> succeeds in portraying the supernova blowout of old-school showbiz in all its dazzling glory.</p>Acclaim for Shawn Levy's <i>King of Comedy: The Life and Art of Jerry Lewis:</i><p>"Superb....Levy's ambitious (and entirely successful) biography is a model of what a celebrity bio ought to be--smart, knowing, insightful, often funny, full of fascinating insiders' stories, always respectful but never worshipful."<br><i>--Los Angeles Times Book Review</i></p><p>"Among the finest, most show business-savvy screen biographies ever written."<br><i>--Boston Phoenix</i></p><p>"One of the great, clear-eyed showbiz biographies of our time--a book worthy of comparison to the genre masterpiece, John Lahr's <i>Notes on a Cowardly Lion.</i>"<br><i>--Boxoffice</i></p><p></p></p><h2>Sacred Geometry: Deciphering the Code</h2><p><p>A fascinating and inspirational look at the vital link between the hidden geometrical order of the universe, geometry in nature, and the geometry of the man-made world.</p><p><i>The Da Vinci Code</i> has awakened the public to the powerful and very ancient idea that religious truths and mathematical principles are intimately intertwined. <i>Sacred Geometry</i> offers an accessible way of understanding how that connection is revealed in nature and the arts. Over the centuries, temple builders have relied on magic numbers to shape sacred spaces, astronomers have used geometry to calculate holy seasons, and philosophers have observed the harmony of the universe in the numerical properties of music. By showing how the discoveries of mathematics are manifested over and over again in biology and physics, and how they have inspired the greatest works of art, this illuminating study reveals the universal principles that link us to the infinite.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p>Stephen Skinner is a renowned author. He has published over 20 books, which have been translated into more than 16 languages, on subjects such as sacred geometry, geomancy and divination, feng shui and prophecy. Location: UK.Skinner, credited with introducing feng shui to the West, continues his search for the underlying order of the world with this beautifully illustrated examination of the notion that some geometries reveal hidden truths about the way the universe operates. Beginning with the Greeks, such as Euclid and Pythagoras, who, Skinner explains, invented geometry as a means of constructing sacred buildings in a way that was pleasing to the gods, the text explores a variety of natural and human-made examples of sacred geometry, including the construction of Stonehenge, the shapes of crystals, and the idea of "living spirals" (the horn of a goat, the shell of a nautilus, or DNA). While some parts of the book are harder to accept than others--see, for example, the discussion of crop circles--Skinner argues persuasively that many aspects of art, architecture, and science are linked through mathematics to universal principles that govern the universe. The book's success depends entirely on how much stock one puts in this basic premise, but Skinner makes a remarkably elegant case. <i>David Pitt</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

While he clarifies the views of each and how they can be related, his aim is not to proselytize either anarchists into Christianity or Christians into anarchy. On the one hand, suggests Ellul, anarchists need to understand that much of their criticism of Christianity applies only to the form of religion that developed, not to biblical faith. Christians, on the other hand, need to look at the biblical texts and not reject anarchy as a political option, for it seems closest to biblical thinking. After charting the background of his own interest in the subject, Ellul defines what he means by anarchy: the nonviolent repudiation of authority. He goes on to look at the Bible as the source of anarchy (in the sense of nondomination, not disorder), working through Old Testament history, Jesus&#39; ministry, and finally the early church&#39;s view of power as reflected in the New Testament writings.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>Dog Diaries #10: Rolf</h2><p><b>A dachshund loses a leg and <i>finds</i> his life's calling&#x2014;as a therapy dog!</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> Scrappy dachshund Rolf von Noodle may be missing a hind leg, but he's got attitude and can-do spirit to spare!

A few years later, after working with great French chefs Bernard Loiseau, Alain Passard, Alain Ducasse and Guy Martin, Mauro decided to open his own place and he settled in Menton, on the Cote de Azur. Through his personal interpretations of ingredients and flavour combinations, Mauro has forged a style of his own. He has absorbed his Italian-Argentinian cultural heritage and that of the chefs with whom he trained, and now follows his intuition as he draws on the local culture on both sides of the border. Inspired by the sea, the mountains and the fruit and vegetables grown in his own gardens, Mauro invents colourful, pictorial dishes that play with textures and bold contrasts. His cuisine is ultra fresh, with lots of herbs, fruit and vegetables showcasing the magnificent ingredients produced by local growers: citrus fruit from the Riviera, saffron from Sospel, olive oil and lemons from Menton, wild mushrooms from the surrounding countryside, produce from the Ventimiglia markets, gamberoni prawns from San Remo, locally caught fish, and so on.

Three years later he would leave the nation breathless as he captured the Triple Crown, shattering records and rivals alike. At The Meadow, America s Super Horse learned to gallop across its rolling fields and its loamy track. There, Secretariat first felt the calming hand of a groom, the taste of a bit in his mouth and the weight of a rider on his back. At The Meadow, the foundation was laid for a legend. Though much has been written about his spectacular racing career, the complete story of Secretariat s birthplace and the Chenery family who raised and raced him has never been told...until now. And a Chenery granddaughter is telling it. Secretariat s Meadow The Land, The Family, The Legend reveals an intimate picture of this storied place from the viewpoint of Kate Chenery Tweedy, daughter of Penny Chenery (Tweedy) and granddaughter of Meadow Stable s founder Christopher T.

However, the complete story of Secretariat's Virginia birthplace and the Chenery family who raised and raced him has never been told...until now. <i>Secretariat's Meadow &#x2013;The Land, The Family, The Legend</i> is by Kate Chenery Tweedy, daughter of Penny Chenery (Tweedy) and granddaughter of Christopher T.

She has accompanied her mother, the first lady of racing, in her travels across the country to keep Secretariat s legacy alive. Kate, an erstwhile lawyer, now teacher, editor, author and family historian, spent three years researching to do justice to the story of her remarkable grandfather and mother whose horses brought the national attention to that timeless place, The Meadow.

A now classic text, the second edition of this essential introduction to epidemiology presents the core concepts in a unified approach that aims to cut through the fog and elucidate the fundamental concepts. Rather than focusing on formulas or dogma, the book presents basic epidemiologic principles and concepts in a coherent and straightforward exposition. By emphasizing a unifying set of ideas, students will develop a strong foundation for understanding the principles of epidemiologic research.<br></p><p><br><strong>Kenneth J. Rothman, DrPH,</strong> is a Distinguished Fellow at RTI International, an independent nonprofit research institute dedicated to improving the human condition. He is also Professor in the Departments of Epidemiology and Medicine at Boston University. His research interests in epidemiology have spanned a wide range of health problems, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, neurologic disease, birth defects, injuries, environmental exposures, and drug epidemiology, but his main career focus has been the development and teaching of the concepts and methods of epidemiologic research.<br><br>"This is an excellent introduction to the principles and concepts of epidemiology. In a little over 200 pages Rothman covers all the essential topics for an introductory graduate level course in epidemiology." --<em>European Journal of Public Health</em><p></p><br>"<em>Epidemiology: An Introduction</em> is a superb addition to other publications that have appeared in the past decade. The author has achieved the stated goal of providing a coherent overview of epidemiologic principles and concepts."--<em>American Journal of Epidemiology</em><p></p><br>"Kenneth Rothman has taken the time to write a short and excellent introductory epidemiology textbook....Frequently introductory texts strive for brevity through superficiality of coverage. Rothman chose a different approach: selectivity of subject matter. As a result, <em>Epidemiology: An</em> <em>Introduction</em> provides an exceptionally lucid overview of analytic epidemiology.... The mix of text, graphics, tables, and sidebars that is used throughout the book proves very useful in explicating important concepts such as confounding, interaction, study design, and biases, which may be challenging to the student in an introductory course.... The clarity of expression in this book should be an inspiration to other authors and teachers of epidemiology."--<em>The Epidemiology Monitor</em><p></p><br>"This text is ideal for beginners in epidemiological statistics to learn the terminology and understand how and when to use statistical tools. The text focuses on concepts, not on mathematics, and discusses statistical techniques in the context of the real problems they can solve. This text bridges the gap between what is taught in an introductory statistics text and what you need to be an effective researcher and analyst." -- STATA <br><p></p><br>"In summary, this book is a brilliant introductory book to learn concepts of epidemiology. In contrast to the many available introductory books (several of them written in a naive way), this book does not trivialize these concepts. It perfectly prepares the reader for the reference book of epidemiologic methods entitled "Modern Epidemiology" by Rothman et al... I am not aware of any other introductory book of epidemiology that presents these many epidemiologic concepts. It is a perfect--although demanding--reader for an introductory course of epidemiology in master programs of epidemiology, public health, and at medical schools." -- European Journal of Epidemiology<p></p><br>"Students and scholars who pursue epidemiology as a career should find this book a useful addition to their library. It does not present different basic concepts and methods than other introductory books do, but it does provide insights into how they developed and should be interpreted. This is a worthwhile new edition." -- <em>Doody's</em> <br> <br><p></p><br></p><h2>Queer Theory Now: From Foundations to Futures</h2><p><p>This short textbook provides an introduction to queer theory, exploring its key genealogies and terms as well as its application across various academic disciplines and to contemporary life more generally.</p><p>The authors engage with a wide range of developments in queer theory thinking including discussions of identity politics, transgender theory, intersectionality, post-colonial theory, Indigenous studies, disability studies, affect theory, and more.</p><p> </p><p>In offering an updated reflection on the present tensions that queer theory must negotiate, as well as its unfolding future(s), <i>Queer Theory Now</i> is an ideal resource for anyone starting out on their queer theory journey; for students who want to get a grasp of the basic concepts, for teachers looking for a textbook for their queer theory course, or for scholars who want a quick go-to resource for key queer theory ideas and terms.&nbsp;</p><p></p></p><p><p>In recent years, queer theory&#x2019;s troubling of binary oppositions and dominant conceptions of fixed identities has been broadening in scope, with increasing attention to issues such as race/ethnicity, disability and intersectionality.

Sayers is considered by many to be the premier detective novelist of the Golden Age, and her dashing sleuth, Lord Peter Wimsey, is one of mystery fiction&#x2019;s most enduring and endearing protagonists. In <em>Clouds of Witness</em>, the fianc� of Lord Peter's sister, Mary, is found dead outside the conservatory of the Wimsey family's shooting lodge in Yorkshire.

What do these leads mean, and why are Mary and Gerald suddenly acting so mysterious? Unraveling a string of coincidences, Lord Peter is determined to solve this intriguing case. But will the answer save his brother . . . or condemn him?</p></p><p><p>Dorothy L. Sayers was born in 1893.

Evans Jr., a major and distinctive voice in American religion, situates theology squarely in the nexus of faith with freedom. There, with a sure touch, he uplifts revelatory aspects of black religious experience that reanimate classical areas of theology, and he creates a theology with a heart, soul, and voice that speak directly to our condition. Edited and introduced by Stephen G. Ray Jr., the second edition, published on the twentieth anniversary of the first, includes three new essays that identify the value of the book for womanist, evangelical, and black church audiences. The new edition concludes with an Afterword by the author himself.</p><p>James H. Evans Jr. is Robert K. Davies Professor of Systematic Theology at Colgate Rochester Crozer Divinity School. He is the author of We Shall All Be Changed (1997), Modern Christian Thought: The Twentieth Century (2nd edition, 2006), and Playing: Christian Explorations of Daily Living (2010), all with Fortress Press.<br>Stephen G. Ray Jr. is Neal F. and Ila A. Fisher Professor of Theology at Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary. His books include Do No Harm: Social Sin and Christian Responsibility (Fortress Press, 2002) and Black Church Studies: An Introduction (2007)."An eloquently crafted outline, Evans's book also introduces readers to the scope and richness of religious belief in African American communities. It demands a place in any of our seminaries introductory courses in theology. While elucidating the conceptual framework for a people's practice of freedom, the book also deftly challenges the hegemonic pedagogies that neglect, marginalize, or trivialize serious study of African American beliefs within what the church has called systematic theology. " --Mark Kline Taylor, Princeton Theological Seminary<br><br>"James Evans's <em>We Have Been Believers</em> is an important book on black theology. It will be useful for both the church and the academy. I recommend it highly." --James H. Cone, Union Theological Seminary, New York City<br><br>"In this second edition of James Evans's seminal work, the theology of the Black Church emerges as a unique, relevant, and dialogical response to the realities of this present age. The addition of new essays focused on the influence of womanist thought, the evangelical movement, and prophetic black church leadership will inspire another generation of believers in the academy and in the pews." --Barbara Holmes, Memphis Theological Seminary<br><br>"The importance of a classic, like James Evans's <em>We Have Been Believers</em>, is not that it is timeless but that it continues to speak to the present and to make contributions to it. In the midst of widespread theological accommodation to the powers that be, Evans blazes alternative trails that are still worth following not only in the black churches but in all churches, inviting us to take our own struggles for liberation and the divine as seriously as the African-American communities that have gone before us." --Joerg Rieger, Perkins School of Theology, Southern Methodist University</p><h2>The Prisoner in the Castle: A Maggie Hope Mystery</h2><p><b>A series of baffling murders among a group of imprisoned agents threatens the outcome of World War II in this chilling mystery from the&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>Mr. Churchill&#x2019;s Secretary</i>.</b><br><br>November, 1942.

The November sun was setting, touching the black and bulky hills of the island with glimmers of gold. Outside the oriel windows, Maggie could see past brittle old apple trees to a flock of geese that had settled in an empty field. Beyond lay the ocean. &#x201c;Six hours of daylight&#x2019;s a meager ration. But then, we&#x2019;re used to rationing now.&#x201d;<br><br>From across a mahogany desk the size of a small boat, Dr. Charles Jaeger permitted himself a smile. He pressed his palms together, his long fingers tapered and elegant. Maggie had met many, many pale older British men since she&#x2019;d moved from Boston to London in 1937, but Jaeger was colorless almost to the point of being invisible&#x2014;�his hair and eyebrows white, his face ashen, his eyes bleached blue. The doctor looked more like an ascetic saint carved from marble than a flesh-�and-�blood man. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re always gazing outside, Miss Hope,&#x201d; he remarked in a low, sonorous voice, sounding amused.<br><br>In the late afternoon light, the sea was a glittering spearmint green. It stretched to the horizon, no land visible, an endless �expanse of rippling water, tipped by white-�capped waves. &#x201c;Looking for an escape, I suppose.&#x201d; Maggie was a slim twenty-�seven-�year-�old woman with thick coppery hair pulled back neatly into a low bun. She put down her knitting needles and the navy sock she was working on&#x2014;�socks for soldiers, each with Morse code V for Victory knit in.<br><br>&#x201c;Watching the play of light on the water has been one of my comforts here&#x2014;�I wish I could draw or paint it. The ocean&#x2019;s huge, deep, and powerful, but we only see the surface. The secret is what lies beneath, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And what do you think lurks below the surface, Miss Hope?&#x201d; The doctor was backlit by the setting sun, a dark silhouette against citrine.<br><br>Foreboding crept over her, making the hairs on the back of her neck rise. We&#x2019;re at war. The enemy always might be closer than we think. &#x201c;U-�boats, most likely. Wolf packs of them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t mean literally.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well then, who knows?&#x201d; Maggie turned her gaze back to him. &#x201c;Salmon, before they make their way back up the rivers and streams to spawn? Sunken pirate ships? Monsters, mermaids&#x2014;�they call them selkies here, don&#x2019;t they? The Blue Men of the Mich?&#x201d; Maggie had learned from the castle&#x2019;s housekeeper that the Blue Men, also called storm kelpies, were a race of sea devils believed to live in the waters of the Hebrides. &#x201c;The sea&#x2019;s always a mystery, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;<br><br>She sat across the desk from him in a red-�leather club chair, noting a shadow box of pinned butterflies hanging on the opposite wall. &#x201c;And what would your Freud say about the ocean, Doctor?&#x201d;<br><br>Dr. Jaeger was a psychologist who visited Forbidden Island once a month. A fisherman named Broden MacLean brought him on his small boat, along with food, supplies, and fresh laundry. The doctor&#x2019;s job was to monitor the physical and mental health of the prisoners&#x2014;�&#x201c;the trainees,&#x201d; as they were euphemistically called. He was always immaculate, his Jermyn Street suits well pressed, his crisp white shirts giving the impression he could perform surgery at any moment. Dr. Jaeger met with each prisoner in the castle&#x2019;s library, a chilly, wood-�paneled space redolent of beeswax polish, cigarette smoke, and dry rot, with glass-�fronted bookcases and dark mahogany panels that stretched up to a plaster-�medallioned ceiling. A reproduction of the English artist Sir Edwin Landseer&#x2019;s The Sanctuary hung over the fireplace&#x2019;s mantel&#x2014;�a painting of a wounded deer who had swum to an island, a momentary place of refuge from the violence of the hunt. In profile, the animal&#x2019;s large dark eye looked both accusing and sad.<br><br>Even though it was a library, the books looked to have been bought for display purposes only. The few tooled leather-�bound tomes that looked read were on hunting and fishing: James Watson Lyall&#x2019;s Sportsman&#x2019;s and Tourist&#x2019;s Guide to the Rivers, Lochs, Moors and Deer Forests of Scotland, Izaak Walton&#x2019;s The Compleat Angler, and the like. They were flanked by a selection of Sir Walter Scott novels, while H. G. Wells&#x2019;s The Island of Doctor Moreau kept company next to a set of Agatha Christie mysteries.<br><br>The bloodcurdling howl of a passing Manx shearwater startled them both. The black and white birds were everywhere on the island, living on top of the rocky peaks of the eroded volcano, their loud screams wild and eerie. As the bird dove, like a Spitfire attacking a U-�boat, the doctor scribbled something in his notebook, then glanced up. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m more of a Jung disciple myself,&#x201d; he told her, &#x201c;and he had quite a bit to say regarding the ocean and the unconscious.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure.&#x201d; Maggie gazed through a sunbeam thick with dust motes to the calendar on the desk&#x2014;�the date was November 12, 1942. Her last memory of being in London was June 22. One hundred and forty-�three days had passed since she&#x2019;d been brought, against her will, to Forbidden Island. For more than twenty weeks, nearly five months, she&#x2019;d been held prisoner in the island&#x2019;s castle, unable to help the war effort, prohibited from letting her friends and family know she was safe. The inmates were completely sequestered. No phone calls were allowed. No letters could be sent or received. No radio communication was permitted. Beyond the castle, there was nowhere to go on the island&#x2014;�no town, no village, only uninhabited woods and lochs.<br><br>Forbidden Island, really the Isle of Scarra, located just off the western coast of Scotland, was a remote overgrown wilderness of three square miles, with moors, forests, craggy inlets, and shining sands. Golden eagles soared overhead and red deer wandered under the pines. There were no boats, of course&#x2014;�beyond the one that visited once a month&#x2014;�but even if there were, the island was surrounded by whirlpools, rendering passage treacherous at best.<br><br>Maggie and her fellow prisoners were housed in what had once been a shooting lodge, an improbably ugly structure called Killoch Castle, with long, unconvincing battlements and graceless corner turrets. The &#x201c;castle&#x201d; was a lumbering reification of Victorian and Edwardian excess, a florid fantasy of a medieval manse built as a private residence in 1900 for Sir Marcus Killoch, a textile tycoon from Lancashire. Sir Marcus had designed the structure in a castellated Tudor style, using blood-�red sandstone shipped over from Annan at great expense. It had its own electricity supply, as well as modern plumbing and heating.<br><br>In its day, the castle had been infamous for luxury and excess. It boasted a Japanese garden, a maze, a bowling green, and a golf course&#x2014;�all created using topsoil imported from Ayrshire. A glass greenhouse had once housed tropical plants and flowers, as well as hummingbirds, turtles, and alligators, while the hunting hounds slept in a heated kennel. There was even a small stone cottage on the side of the mountain, a hermitage for a resident hermit, who would dispense wisdom to any inquiring guests. When Marcus Killoch died in 1922, he&#x2019;d left no heirs. And when the war had broken out, the abandoned castle was taken over by the British government.<br><br>Maggie hated Killoch Castle. She thought it one of the most loathsome buildings she&#x2019;d ever seen, a monument to colossal ego, bad taste, and greed. In her opinion, Marcus Killoch was the worst kind of nouveau riche Englishman, who played at being an island laird with his toy castle, rifles, and hunting trophies.<br><br>Dr. Jaeger remained silent, pen poised over paper. Maggie understood what he was doing; his prolonged silence was a technique, designed to make her talk. She recognized it from her spy training with the SOE. Still, she knew she could outlast him; he had nothing on the Gestapo interrogator she&#x2019;d encountered in Paris.<br><br>Without compromising his ramrod posture, Dr. Jaeger tilted his head, face blank as a Lewis stone. &#x201c;This is your fifth session, Miss Hope. And you haven&#x2019;t revealed anything yet. Anything of real import, that is.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I like the peace in the library, Doctor. It&#x2019;s an excellent place to think.&#x201d; She picked up her half-�finished sock. &#x201c;And to knit. Since I can&#x2019;t be an SOE agent anymore&#x2014;�or do anything to help the war effort, really&#x2014;�the least I can do is help keep our soldiers&#x2019; feet warm.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not alone, Miss Hope. Most agents brought to the island rankle at even the idea of mandated therapy.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, not me. I know you&#x2019;re just doing your job. So, let&#x2019;s make this simple. When you realize I really and truly won&#x2019;t talk&#x2014;�at least not about what those in the British Intelligence fear I might let slip&#x2014;�you&#x2019;ll release me. And I&#x2019;ll go back to regular life.&#x201d; She smiled. &#x201c;And since I&#x2019;ll never talk, you might as well let me go now.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ah, Miss Hope.&#x201d; He raised his eyebrows. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid it&#x2019;s not that easy. And even if it were, I don&#x2019;t have the authority to release you, or anyone.&#x201d;<br><br>Maggie&#x2019;s needles stopped midpurl. &#x201c;Tell me what I need to do. To get out of this place. To leave this moldering castle and get off this island. Who can you talk to? Colonel Martens? Tell him I won&#x2019;t say anything. And I never will. I signed the Official Secrets Act.&#x201d;<br><br>She had once been part of a mission greater than herself, and now she missed it desperately. There was a war going on, a global war determining if people lived in freedom or died in slavery, and she wanted to do her bit. Something. Anything. Because without victory there would be no survival, for her or anyone she loved. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m no good to anyone locked away here. All the trouble His Majesty&#x2019;s government went through to train me, just wasted.&#x201d;<br><br>Maggie had been brought to Forbidden Island because she&#x2019;d been asked by Colonel Martens to participate in a lie she&#x2019;d felt was reprehensible. It wasn&#x2019;t lost on her that she&#x2019;d been asked, and refused, only days after escaping from Gestapo custody in Nazi-�occupied Paris, a costly disaster both professionally and personally. And yet&nbsp;. . .<br><br>The question still tormented Maggie, even after time on the island to think. How desperate must a situation be for a certain action to be acceptable in war? How heinous must a course of action become before people decide a line has been crossed? And was it forgivable in the fight against an evil as pernicious as Nazism? Does the end ever justify the tainted means?<br><br>&#x201c;Miss Hope, when you were first here, you didn&#x2019;t speak for weeks.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2014;�I had nothing to say.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You stayed in bed.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I was tired. That mission to Paris was exhausting.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You threw things at the nurse. A vase of flowers, if I recall.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I threw the vase at the wall, not the nurse,&#x201d; she clarified, resuming her knitting. &#x201c;The flowers annoyed me. So very&nbsp;. . . cheerful. I loathe marigolds.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So you do remember the first weeks you were here.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Some of it,&#x201d; Maggie admitted.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you remember we had to sedate you? And, one night, straitjacket you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No!&#x201d; Maggie had recollections of slipping through the cracks of sanity and going under, but she wasn&#x2019;t about to discuss them. Then, calmer: &#x201c;No, I don&#x2019;t recall.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you remember why you were brought here?&#x201d;<br><br>Yes, I do&#x2014;�but you&#x2019;re daft if you think I&#x2019;ll tell you.<br><br>&#x201c;You were in F-�Section,&#x201d; Dr. Jaeger prodded. &#x201c;What went wrong in Paris?&#x201d;<br><br>Maggie wasn&#x2019;t about to take the bait. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s cold today, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; She set down the sock and buttoned up her heavy wool cardigan.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re changing the subject.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;As you well know, Doctor, I never discuss war-�related information&#x2014;�with anyone.&#x201d;<br><br>Dr. Jaeger gave a wry smile. &#x201c;I can see you&#x2019;re still suspicious. And I understand why.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m under house arrest. Whatever I say to you, you&#x2019;ll undoubtedly relay to them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And who is them?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Colonel Henrik Martens, Churchill&#x2019;s so-�called Master of Deception. Colonel Bishop with MI-�Six. And whoever else they&#x2019;re working with. The people in charge of&nbsp;. . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of what, Maggie?&#x201d;<br><br>F-�Section.

It was the culmination of a criminal career that author Jeff Guinn traces back to Manson&#x2019;s childhood. Guinn interviewed Manson&#x2019;s sister and cousin, neither of whom had ever previously cooperated with an author. Childhood friends, cellmates, and even some members of the Manson family have provided new information about Manson&#x2019;s life. Guinn has made discoveries about the night of the Tate murders, answering unresolved questions, such as why one person near the scene of the crime was spared.<br> <br><i>Manson</i> puts the killer in the context of the turbulent late sixties, an era of race riots and street protests when authority in all its forms was under siege. Guinn shows us how Manson created and refined his message to fit the times, persuading confused young women (and a few men) that he had the solutions to their problems. At the same time he used them to pursue his long-standing musical ambitions. His frustrated ambitions, combined with his bizarre race-war obsession, would have lethal consequences. <br> <br>Guinn&#x2019;s book is a &#x201c;tour de force of a biography...<i>Manson</i> stands as a definitive work: important for students of criminology, human behavior, popular culture, music, psychopathology, and sociopathology...and compulsively readable&#x201d; (Ann Rule, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i>).</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, August 2013:</strong> For more than 40 years, Charles Manson has cast an awful shadow over the Age of Aquarius: an unrepentant murderer synonymous with <i>psychopath</i> in the American lexicon, impossible to ignore or forget. Accordingly, there&#x2019;s no measuring the volume of ink and celluloid committed to the man, his &#x201c;family,&#x201d; and their deeds. So what&#x2019;s left to be said about Charles Manson? Quite a bit, it turns out. With <i>Manson</i>, Jeff Guinn delves deep into Manson&#x2019;s &#x201c;origin story&#x201d; to reconstruct the wicked combination of events and circumstance that helped make the monster. In prose that&#x2019;s both economical and compelling--almost hard-boiled--Guinn recounts a troubled upbringing of neglectful, criminal parents and juvenile delinquency, compelling the narrative into the increasingly bizarre landscapes of late-1960s Southern California--a context that turned out to be the perfect accelerant to Manson&#x2019;s narcissistic delusions. By the time of Helter Skelter and the infamous Manson Family killings, Guinn has aligned the tumblers of Manson&#x2019;s story and opened a vault of secrets regarding one of the most violent and strange episodes of modern American history. --<i>Jon Foro</i>Jeff Guinn is an&nbsp;award-winning former investigative journalist and the bestselling author of numerous books, including <i>Go Down Together: The True Untold Story of Bonnie and Clyde</i>;<i> The Last Gunfight: The Real Story of the Shootout at the OK Corral&#x2014;And How It Changed the West</i>;&nbsp;<i>Manson: The Life and Times of Charles Manson</i>; and <i>The Road to Jonestown: Jim Jones and Peoples Temple</i>. Guinn lives in Fort Worth, Texas.</p><h2>The Complete Francis of Assisi: His Life, The Complete Writings, and The Little Flowers (Paraclete Giants)</h2><p>There are many editions of the writings of St. Francis, and biographies about him, but here in one volume are both, plus the complete text of the late medieval work, The Little Flowers, which did more to establish the legend of the man than any other work. This &#34;Paraclete Giants&#34; edition includes the complete Road to Assisi, Paul Sabatier&#39;s ground-breaking and foundational biography of the saint, first published in French in 1894 and re-issued and expanded in 2002; the complete Francis in His Own Words: The Essential Writings; and The Little Flowers, thus offering the best introduction to St. Francis yet available between two covers. Other Paraclete Giants include The Complete Julian of Norwich and The Complete Introduction to the Devout Life, both translated and introduced by Fr. John-Julian, OJN.</p><p>Jon M. Sweeney is an independent scholar, author, and culture critic with a wide range of interests. Since 2004, he has been the editor-in-chief of Paraclete Press in Massachusetts.[<b>Stared Review</b>] It&#x2019;s difficult to think of a saint more widely recognized and beloved than Francis of Assisi (1181&#x2013;1226 CE). Sweeney (When Saint Francis Saved the Church) has brought together Paul Sabatier&#x2019;s important 1894 biography of the saint and almost all of Francis&#x2019;s own writings and prayers including the classic The Little Flowers, an early anthology of anecdotes, teaching tales, and legends about Francis and the first generation of his followers. The author has annotated Sabatier&#x2019;s work, and the translations and arrangement of the material are also his. VERDICT It is immensely valuable to have in one volume the key writings by and about Francis and his first disciples; essential for libraries and individuals looking to expand their knowledge of this influential saint. <b>&#x2014;Library Journal</b><br>Paraclete Press has a number of books on Christian Spirituality. Their&nbsp;<i>Paraclete Giants&nbsp;</i>series presents the complete works of various saints.&nbsp;I have several of these. They are affordable editions of Christian classics.&nbsp;<i>The Complete Francis of Assisi&nbsp;</i>is an exceptional volume and a great edition to the series.&nbsp;<br><p><i>Francis&#x2019;s Essential Writings&nbsp;</i>is of the most historical interest to me. Here is Francis in his own words&#x2013;letters, prayers and monastic rules. These are important documents of the early Franciscan movement. Sweeney&#x2019;s introductions and comments provide context for each piece of writing.&nbsp;<i>The Little Flowers&nbsp;</i>is&nbsp;well known and well loved. What sets this edition apart from others (other than Sweeney&#x2019;s translation) is their arrangement. Sweeney places these stories in what he thinks is their most straightforward chronological rendering (rather than the traditional order. Anyone interested in Francis and the movement he founded will love this volume. If you do not have any Francis on your shelf, this is a good deal. I give it five stars.<b>&#x2014;James Matichuk, <i>thoughts, prayers &amp; songs</i></b></p><br>Saint Francis of Assisi is easily one of the most recognized saints, right up there in popularity and appealing warmth with Santa Claus. The Complete Francis of Assisi seeks to create a loving, inspiring portrait of the man who abandoned his father&#x2019;s riches to wander the Italian countryside, ministering to lepers and preaching to birds. The book is actually three books in one: a gentle biography, a selection of writings by the saint himself, and a collection of medieval tales meant to popularize his legacy. Readers won&#x2019;t find anything that drastically changes their perceptions of the lover of Lady Poverty, who nicknamed his own body Brother Ass, and the inclusion of three separate books means that some anecdotes are repeated. But the editor-translator&#x2019;s clear love for his subject shines through, and the readers are left feeling they have spent some quality time with the man who continues to inspire us to contemplate abandoning our worldly possessions. In the company of a man like Francis, it seems like a good idea.<b>&#x2014;Christine Engel, <i>Booklist</i></b><br> Paraclete Press now has published this comprehensive collection of materials on Francis of Assisi as another volume in a very useful series, &#x201c;Paraclete Giants,&#x201d; with others on Julian of Norwich, Th�r�se of Lisieux, the Imitation of Christ, among other classics in the spiritual life.&nbsp; Jon Sweeny is known for his work on Francis with numerous other publications, most recently&nbsp;<i>When St. Francis Saved the Church</i>, reviewed here by me.<br> Once more, I can recommend a book by him with enthusiasm and gratitude. Sweeney brings together several important resources in one volume. There is first, the classic biography of Francis by Paul Sabatier, but with a great deal of editing and added material. Additional resources include a glossary of terms, a very helpful listing of major figures as well as sources for further reading. The second component is the essential writings of Francis. Here Sweeny provides fluid, accessible translation and notes as well as ample bibliography. Lastly, there is a well edited, revised translation of the important early narrative on Francis and his life , the&nbsp;<i>fioretti&nbsp;</i>or &#x201c;little flowers,&#x201d; a collection of accounts by different authors done and collected a century or so after Francis&#x2019; death.&nbsp;&nbsp;This, like other volumes in the series such as the one on Julian, will be a welcome resource for lectio divina, for what is contained is the substance of Francis&#x2019; words and actions. Having all these sources together and in such a clear, accessible version will make this a valuable book for retreats, for courses on the spiritual life as well as on major figures in that life.<br> Today, the bishop of Rome, the pope&#x2019;s taking on not just the name of Francis&#x2014;the first time ever for the head of the Catholic church&#x2014;but also this same Pope Francis&#x2019; daring to speak out against world economic systems, against the abuse of the natural environment, on behalf of the marginalized&#x2014;all this has created yet another anti-Franciscan backlash, a sign of the way in which the &#x201c;little poor man&#x201d; of Assisi remains a sign of contradiction and challenge in the church. This fine volume is perhaps the most complete encounter in print one could have with him. The detail from Giotto&#x2019;s beautiful fresco in the upper basilica in Assisi on the cover, of Francis preaching to the birds, is another wonderful vision.&#x2014;&nbsp;<b>Michael Plekon, Baruch College of the City University of New York</b><br><br>Saint Francis of Assisi was born October 3, 1226 as Giovanni di Pietro di Bernardone, but nicknamed Francesco and became an Italian Catholic friar and preacher. He founded the men's Order of Friars Minor, the women's Order of St. Clare, and the Third Order of Saint Francis for men and women not able to live the lives of itinerant preachers. Francis is one of the most venerated religious figures in Roman Catholic history. "The Complete Francis of Assisi: His Life, The Complete Writings, and The Little Flowers" is a 416 page compendium comprised of an annotated account of his life and all of his surviving writings ably edited and translated into English for an American readership by independent scholar, author, and culture critic Jon M. Sweeney (who was the editor-in-chief of the Massachusetts-based Paraclete Press from 2004-2015). Deftly organized and presented with insightful commentaries, "The Complete Francis of Assisi" is enhanced with the inclusion of a five page listing of succinctly presented biographical sketches of the Franciscan Friars; a two page listing of suggestions for further reading. A truly impressive work and 'reader friendly' work, "The Complete Francis of Assisi" is very highly recommended for community, church, and academic library Christian Studies and Christian Biography collections in general, and Franciscan History supplemental studies lists in particular. For personal reading lists it should be noted that "The Complete Francis of Assisi" is also available in a Kindle edition ($18.95).<b>&#x2014;<i>The Midwest Book Review</i></b><br><br><br><p><i>The Complete Francis of Assisi: His Life, The Complete Writings, and The Little Flowers Ed.</i>, translated and introduced by Jon M.

Sweeney edited the material of three classic Francis texts and brought them together in one convenient location. The individual titles that constitute this single work on Francis are&nbsp;<i>Road to Assisi, Francis of Assisi in His Own Words: The Essential Writings,&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>The Little Flowers.&nbsp;</i>This four hundred-page book may seem daunting considering it seeks to introduce a simple and unassuming man of God, but the reader will soon be captivated by the message and transformed in heart. The reader will discover the man Francis, his writings, and his living legacy. Sweeney does an admirable job introducing, annotating, and contemporizing each of the three classic French texts. It should also be noted that this title is part of a new series created by Paraclete Press called Paraclete Giants which specifically gathers the materials that profile the life, deeds, and words of Catholic luminaries in one place.</p><p><i>The Complete Francis of Assisi&nbsp;</i>is recommended for all libraries seeking to update some classic texts.<br><b>&#x2014;John Leonard Berg, Catholic Library World</b></p></p><h2>St. Michael and the Angels: A Month With St. Michael and the Holy Angels</h2><p>Beautiful and inspiring book about the angels, full of stories from the Saints.

McDonnell reveals the vital role played by the native peoples of the Great Lakes in the history of North America. Though less well known than the Iroquois or Sioux, the Anishinaabeg, who lived across Lakes Michigan and Huron, were equally influential. <i>Masters of Empire </i>charts the story of one group, the Odawa, who settled at the straits between those two lakes, a hub for trade and diplomacy throughout the vast country west of Montreal known as the <i>pays d&#x2019;en haut</i>.</p><p> Highlighting the long-standing rivalries and relationships among the great Indian nations of North America, McDonnell shows how Europeans often played only a minor role in this history, and reminds us that it was native peoples who possessed intricate and far-reaching networks of commerce and kinship. As empire encroached upon their domain, the Anishinaabeg were often the ones doing the exploiting. By dictating terms at trading posts and frontier forts, they played a crucial part in the making of early America.</p><p>Through vivid depictions--all from a native perspective--of early skirmishes, the French and Indian War, and the American Revolution, <i>Masters of Empire </i>overturns our assumptions about colonial America. By calling attention to the Great Lakes as a crucible of culture and conflict, McDonnell reimagines the landscape of American history.</p></p><p><b>Michael McDonnell </b>is an associate professor of history at the University of Sydney. He is the author of <i>The Politics of War: Race, Class, and Conflict in Revolutionary Virginia</i>, <i></i>winner of the 2008 New South Wales Premier's History <i></i>Award, and coeditor of <i>Remembering the Revolution: Memory, History, and Nation Making from Independence to the Civil War</i>.

With a fascinating reexamination of the political, military, and economic details of the war, as well as a stunning final chapter on the American Revolution and the meaning of (in)dependence, McDonnell admirably expands readers' understanding of &#x2018;Indian country on its own terms.&#x2019;&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>&#x201c;McDonnell skillfully captures the history of the [Anishinaabeg] from the 17th century through the early 19th century, restoring the nation's legacy and filling in a vital historical link in the timeline of the Americas.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>&#x201c;In clear and compelling prose Michael A. McDonnell renders a complicated world accessible, a marginalized region central, and a neglected history essential. Rethinking pivotal events from indigenous centers like Michilimackinac rather than from colonial capitals like Boston or Williamsburg, <i>Masters of Empire </i>provides an important perspective for a richer understanding of early American history.&#x201d; &#x2015;Collin G. Calloway, John Kimball Jr. 1943 professor of history, Dartmouth College</p><p>&#x201c;In recent years scholars have begun to argue that the center of America&#x2019;s historical gravity should shift from the East Coast to the heart of the continent. Michael A. McDonnell&#x2019;s <i>Masters of Empire</i> makes an important contribution to that reorientation. Piecing together the story of the Anishinaabeg in general and the Odawa of Michilimackinac in particular, McDonnell offers a new perch from which to view &#x2018;the course of human events&#x2019; during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, thereby making a powerful case for Michilimackinac&#x2019;s joining Boston, Philadelphia, and other, better-known capitals vital to understanding America&#x2019;s past.&#x201d; &#x2015;James H. Merrell, Lucy Maynard Salmon Professor of History, Vassar College</p><p>&#x201c;This is a sweeping and majestic analysis of the colonial Great Lakes, which places the Odawa people at the heart of a new understanding about how the French and later, the British were thwarted in their attempts to shape and control this region.&#x201d; &#x2015;Susan Sleeper-Smith, professor of history, Michigan State University</p><p>&#x201c;With elegant prose and a keen eye for detail, Michael A. McDonnell brings to life the dynamic world of Great Lakes Indians in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. This is native-centered history at its best, revealing how the Odawa and their neighbors not only controlled their own destinies in the face of colonialism, but also shaped the fabric of American life for many generations. A powerful story expertly told.&#x201d; &#x2015;Brett Rushforth, author of Bonds of Alliance: Indigenous and Atlantic Slaveries in New France</p><p>&#x201c;Insightful and evocative, <i>Masters of Empire</i> compels us to rethink colonial America by restoring native peoples to the center of the story. Along vast waterways in the heart of a continent, natives controlled the intrusive but weak officials and traders of distant empires. Michael A. McDonnell brilliantly recovers and deftly narrates a tale of resourceful persistence by the Anishinaabeg.&#x201d; &#x2015;Alan Taylor, author of The Civil War of 1812: American Citizens, British Subjects, Irish Rebels, and Indian Allies</p><p>&#x201c;With lively prose and page-turning action, Michael McDonnell introduces readers to a whole new world. Everyone interested in American history should read this magisterial tale of how the Anishinaabe Odawa lived through and shaped the history of North America and the early modern world.&#x201d; &#x2015;Kathleen DuVal, professor of history, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill</p><p>&#x201c;Michael A. McDonnell shows that for much longer than anyone has dared to imagine, Great Lakes Indians stood firm as the masters of their own destiny&#x2015;and powerfully influenced events as iconic as the American Revolution.&#x201d; &#x2015;Woody Holton, author of Abigail Adams</p><p>&#x201c;In this tour de force, Michael A. McDonnell brilliantly shows how the Anishinaabeg of the Upper Great Lakes played a crucial role in the run-up to the American Revolution. This 'native-driven' history will send historians scurrying to revise their interpretation of imperial and native rivalries in the mid-continent west of the Appalachians.&#x201d; &#x2015;Gary Nash, professor of history, University of California, Los Angeles</p></p><h2>Somerset</h2><p><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES </i>BESTSELLER<i><br><br>Gone with the Wind</i> meets <i>The Help</i> in the stunning prequel to Leila Meacham's bestselling family epic <i>Roses</i>.</b><br><br><i>"From birth, Jessica had eschewed the role to which she'd been born.

Spanning more than six decades, Somerset takes readers back to 1835 as Silas Toliver and Jeremy Warwick, younger sons of wealthy plantation owners, prepare to leave South Carolina in search of greater fortune in Texas. In a classic Meacham twist, Silas is forced to marry Jessica Wyndham, a headstrong heiress who harbors abolitionist sentiments. Love eventually grows between them and they form the foundation upon which retired high-school English teacher Meacham built Roses. Though Meacham sets her tale against the backdrop of historical upheavals, even the Civil War takes a backseat to the Tolivers&#x2019; domestic dramas full of intrigue and tragedy. Like many multigenerational sagas, Somerset aims for breadth, not depth, and loses a bit of steam as its original characters, whom Meacham develops with great care, cede the stage to a succession of offspring lacking similar spark.

These paintings of the wilderness evoke the same response in viewers today as they did when first exhibited. </p><p> <b>The Group of Seven and Tom Thomson</b> includes many never -- before reproduced paintings and presents the most complete and extensive collection of these artists' works ever published. The 400 paintings and drawings reveal the remarkable genius of all 10 painters who at some point were part of the movement. Tom Thomson, who died before the Group was established, was always present in the public mind. Included are works by:</p><ul> <li>Frank Carmichael</li> <li>Frank Johnston</li> <li>A.J. Casson</li> <li>Arthur Lismer</li> <li>Le Moine FitzGerald</li> <li>J.E.H. MacDonald</li> <li>Lawren Harris</li> <li>Tom Thomson</li> <li>Edwin Holgate</li> <li>F.H. Varley</li> <li>A.Y.

Introductory essays provide a context for a greater understanding and appreciation of Canada's most celebrated artists. </p></p><p><p> In Canada, everyone grew up with and loved reproductions of paintings by the Group of Seven and Tom Thomson. These painters (all eleven of them!) defined the way Canadians saw their country. </p><p> The Group was formed in 1920 and exhibited together only eight times from 1920 to 1931 before they disbanded in 1933. One member dropped out right after the first exhibition; another was added in 1926, another in 1929, and yet another in 1932, but the name, with delightful illogic, remained unchanged. 'The Group had no formal organization,' A.Y. Jackson wrote later, 'and since we had no money we had no need of a treasurer.' They never painted together as a group, and indeed on only two occasions did even four of them paint together. Their main focal points in Toronto were their studios and the Arts and Letters Club, where they regularly had lunch together. </p><p> You would think that such an important art movement, which determined the course of Canadian painting for decades, would have many publications to honour and display their work. But, until now, there has not been a single volume in which a generous selection of work by each member could be seen. Out of 369 colour plates, nearly a third are reproduced here for the first time. They show the wide range of subjects that attracted the Group: landscapes from the Atlantic to the Pacific and Arctic oceans, cities, towns, villages, and farms, people, flowers, and the turmoil of the First World War. This is as large a compendium of these magnificent works as is likely to be published in our time. </p><p> <b>David P.

It provides step-by-step instructions in the form of a long letter addressed to Philothea, or one who loves God. The book teaches that anyone can live a life devoted to God, even while remaining in ordinary life. Contents include how to cultivate the desire for a devout life; the means of raising the soul to God by prayer and the sacraments; the practice of virtues; advice against temptations; and renewing the soul and confirming it in its devotion. Francois de Sales (1567-1622) was bishop of Geneva and an energetic evangelist in the Savoy region of his native France. The wisdom of St. Francis&#39; advice is confirmed by the fact that the book&#39;s spiritual value has been proved in four centuries of Christian lives.</p><p></p><h2>Clarice Bean: The Utterly Complete Collection</h2><p><b>Three Clarice Bean novels in one box! &#x201c;Clarice is quickly stepping out from behind the shadow of other witty characters such as Junie B.

With them, writers have saved lives and taken them, brought justice and confounded it, started wars and ended them. Writers can change the way we think and transform our definitions of right and wrong.<br><br><i>Writing to Change the World</i> is a beautiful paean to the transformative power of words. Encapsulating Mary Pipher's years as a writer and therapist, it features rousing commentary, personal anecdotes, memorable quotations, and stories of writers who have helped reshape society. It is a book that will shake up readers' beliefs, expand their minds, and possibly even inspire them to make their own mark on the world.</p><p><b>Mary Pipher</b>, Ph.D., is a psychologist and the author of nine books, including the <i>New York Times </i>bestsellers <i>Reviving Ophelia, The Shelter of Each Other</i>, and <i>Another Country</i>, as well as <i>Seeking Peace</i> and <i>Writing to Change the World. </i>She lives in Nebraska.In this very personal writing guide, Pipher talks about the importance of point of view in writing, and she has a definite point of view here, tilting to the left: the world is in a bad way, and writers can serve as a "rescue team for our tired, overcrowded planet" by "tell[ing] stories that connect readers to all the people on earth." Pipher offers some good examples of how to accomplish this, particularly in a thoughtful and clever essay that presents the U.S. as a patient in a therapeutic case study ("Diagnosis: Post-traumatic stress disorder, multiple addictions"). And she offers useful advice in her sections on defining success (measured not in terms of sales but in terms of "giv[ing] our time and talents to help others") and revising, which she compares to pruning and weeding. There are dozens of pithy and inspiring quotes from a variety of writers, among them Woody Allen, Joan Didion and Eudora Welty. Those, along with Pipher's chipper you-can-do-it tone, will encourage idealistic aspiring writers, who will surely find inspiration in her assertion that writing can heal the world. <i>(Apr.)</i>Correction: Our review of Gary Schwartz's <i>The G.O.D.

Also gives an introduction to each of the Bible&#39;s 72 books, with well-chosen Scriptural passages from most of the books that render a representative example of what they are like and about. First published in 1932, it is nevertheless not dated; the information contained here remains as valid as the traditional Catholic teaching it presents.</p><p>Father John Laux, M.A., was a high school religion teacher who wrote his own Catholic curricular books after spending a large number of years teaching and researching. His works were first published in 1928 and include <i>Catholic Apologetics</i>, <i>Mass and the Sacraments</i>, <i>Introduction to the Bible</i>, <i>Catholic Morality</i> and <i>Church History</i>. He capsulated the Catholic faith extremely well, thanks to his lively prose and succinct way of accurately explaining the details of theology. Though Father Laux originally wrote his books for high school students, they remain very informative for those in college and even adulthood as well. He wrote in a timeless, direct and to-the-point style that continues to present Catholics with in-depth explanations of their faith today.<br></p><h2>The Walking Dead Book 13 (The Walking Dead, 13)</h2><p>After a devastating encounter with the Whisperers, Rick must rally the communities to take action.

As John Ashbery has written<i>, </i>"The private self . . . melts imperceptibly into the large utterance, the grandeur of poetry, which, because it remains rooted in everyday particulars, never sounds &#x2018;grand,' but is as quietly convincing as everyday speech."</p></p><p><p><b>Elizabeth Bishop</b> (1911-1979) was born in Worcester, Massachusetts. She traveled widely as an adult, living for years in France and then Brazil, before returning to the United States.</p><p>&#x201c;The extraordinary thing about Miss Bishop is that she is both a public and a private poet, or perhaps her poetry by its very existence renders obsolete these two after all artificial distinctions (artificial insofar as poetry is concerned). The private self--the quirkiness, the rightness of vision, the special sights and events (a moose, a filling station) that have intrigued Miss Bishop to the point of poetry--melts imperceptibly into the larger utterance, the grandeur of poetry, which, because it remains rooted in everyday particulars, never sounds &#x2018;grand,' but is as quietly convincing as everyday speech.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>John Ashbery</i></p><p>&#x201c;Through masterful fusions of metaphor, Bishop creates a new world and resolves and dissolves its differences in the dazzling dialectic of her vision.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Jane Shore, Ploughshares</i></p></p><h2>The Joy of Piano Duets</h2><p>A glorious mix of fabulous pieces for two!

It splattered hot against Jos&#x2019;s skin-gloved hand. He cursed.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hey, here&#x2019;s an idea&#x2014;would somebody with nothing better to do mind putting a pressor field on that bleeder?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Pressor generator is broken again, Doc.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Republic battle surgeon Jos Vondar looked away from the bloody operating field that was the clone trooper&#x2019;s open chest, at Tolk, his scrub nurse. &#x201c;Of course it is,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;What, is our mech droid on vacation? How am I supposed to patch up these rankweed suckers without working medical gear?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Tolk le Trene, a Lorrdian who could read his mood as easily as most sentients could read a chart, said nothing aloud, but her pointed look was plain enough: Hey, I didn&#x2019;t break it.<br> &nbsp;<br> With an effort, Jos throttled back his temper. &#x201c;All right. Put a clamp on it. We still have hemostats, don&#x2019;t we?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> But she was ahead of him, already locking the steel pincer on the torn blood vessel and using a hemosponge to soak and clear the field. The troopers of this unit had been too close to a grenade when it exploded, and this one&#x2019;s chest had been peppered full of shrapnel. The recent battle in the Poptree Forest had been a bad one&#x2014;the medlifters would surely be hauling in more wounded before nightfall to go with those they already had.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Is it just me, or is it hot in here?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> One of the circulating nurses wiped Jos&#x2019;s forehead to keep the sweat from running into his eyes. &#x201c;Air cooler&#x2019;s malfunctioning again,&#x201d; she said. Jos didn&#x2019;t reply. On a civilized world, he would have sprayed sweat-stop on his face before he scrubbed, but that, like everything else&#x2014;including tempers&#x2014;was in short supply here on Drongar. The temperature outside, even now, near midnight, was that of human body heat; tomorrow it would be hotter than a H&#x2019;nemthe in love. The air would be wetter. And smellier. This was a nasty, nasty world at the best of times; it was far worse with a war going on. Jos wondered, not for the first time, what high-ranking Republic official had casually decided to ruin his life by cutting orders shipping him to a planet that seemed to be all mold and mildew and mushroomlike vegetation as far as the eye could see.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Is everything broken around here?&#x201d; he demanded of the room at large.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Everything except your mouth, sounds like,&#x201d; Zan said pleasantly, without looking up from the trooper he was working on.<br> &nbsp;<br> Jos used a healy gripper to dig a piece of metal the size of his thumb from his patient&#x2019;s left lung. He dropped the sharp metal bit into a pan. It clanked. &#x201c;Put a glue stat on that.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The nurse expertly laid the dissolvable patch onto the wounded lung. The stat, created of cloned tissue and a type of adhesive made from a Talusian mussel, immediately sealed the laceration. At least they still had plenty of those, Jos told himself; otherwise, he&#x2019;d have to use staples or sutures, like the medical droids usually did, and wouldn&#x2019;t that be fun and time-consuming?<br> &nbsp;<br> He looked down at the patient, spotted another gleam of shrapnel under the bright OT lights, and grabbed it gently, wiggling it slowly out. It had just missed the aorta. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s enough scrap metal in this guy to build two battle droids,&#x201d; he muttered, &#x201c;and still have some left over for spare parts.&#x201d; He dropped the metal into the steel bowl, with another clink. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know why they even bother putting armor on &#x2019;em.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Got that right,&#x201d; Zan said. &#x201c;Stuff won&#x2019;t stop anything stronger than a kid&#x2019;s pellet gun.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jos put two more fragments of the grenade into the pan, then straightened, feeling his lower back muscles protest the position he&#x2019;d been locked into all day. &#x201c;Scope &#x2019;im,&#x201d; he said.<br> &nbsp;<br> Tolk ran a handheld bioscanner over the clone. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s clean,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I think you got it all.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll know if he starts clanking when he walks.&#x201d; An orderly began wheeling the gurney over to the two FX-7 medical droids that were doing the patching up. &#x201c;Next!&#x201d; Jos said wearily. He yawned behind his face mask, and before he&#x2019;d finished there was another trooper supine in front of him.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Sucking chest wound,&#x201d; Tolk said. &#x201c;Might need a new lung.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;He&#x2019;s lucky; we&#x2019;re having a special on them.&#x201d; Jos made the initial incision with the laser scalpel. Operating on clone troopers&#x2014;or, as the staff of Rimsoo Seven tended to call it, working the &#x201c;assembly line&#x201d;&#x2014;was easier in a lot of ways than doing slice and stitch on individuals. And, since they were all the same genome, their organs were literally interchangeable, with no worry about rejection syndrome.<br> &nbsp;<br> He glanced over at one of the four other organic doctors working in the cramped operating chamber. Zan Yant, a Zabrak surgeon, was two tables away, humming a classical tune as he sliced. Jos knew Zan would much rather be back in the cubicle the two of them shared, playing his quetarra, tuning it just right so that it would produce the plangent notes of some Zabrak native skirl. The music Zan was into lately sounded like two krayt dragons mating, as far as Jos was concerned, but to a Zabrak&#x2014;and to many other sentient species in the galaxy&#x2014;it was uplifting and enriching. Zan had the soul and the hands of a musician, but he was also a decent surgeon, because the Republic needed medics more than entertainers these days. Certainly on this world.<br> &nbsp;<br> The remaining six surgeons in the theater were droids, and there should have been ten of them. Two of the other four were out for repairs, and two had been requisitioned but never received. Every so often Jos went through the useless ritual of filing another 22K97(MD) requisition form, which would then promptly disappear forever into a vortex of computerized filing systems and bureaucracy.<br> &nbsp;<br> He quickly determined that the sergeant&#x2014;the remnants of his armor had the green markings that denoted his rank&#x2014;indeed needed a new lung. Tolk brought a freshly cloned organ from the nutrient tanks while Jos began the pneumonectomy. In less than an hour he had finished resecting, and the lung, grown from cultured stem cells along with dozens of other identical organs and kept in cryogenic stasis for emergencies such as this, was nestled in the sergeant&#x2019;s pleural cavity. The patient was wheeled over for suturing as Jos stretched, feeling vertebrae unkink and joints pop.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the last of them,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;for now.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t get too comfortable,&#x201d; said Leemoth, a Duros surgeon who specialized in amphibious and semiaquatic species. He looked up from his current patient&#x2014;an Otolla Gungan observer from Naboo, who had had his buccal cavity severely varicosed by a sonic pistol blast the day before. &#x201c;Word from the front is, another couple of medlifters will be here in the next three hours, if not sooner.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Time enough to have a drink and file another pathetic plea for a transfer,&#x201d; Jos said as he moved toward the disinfect chamber, pulling off the skin-gloves as he went. He had learned long ago to cope with whatever was wrong now and not worry about future problems until he had to. It was the mental equivalent of triage, he had told Klo Merit, the Equani physician who was also Rimsoo Seven&#x2019;s resident empath. Merit had blinked his large, brown eyes, their depths so strangely calming, and said that Jos&#x2019;s attitude was healthy&#x2014;up to a degree.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;There is a point at which defense becomes denial,&#x201d; Merit had said. &#x201c;For each of us, that point is positioned differently. A large part of mental hygiene lies simply in knowing when you are no longer being truthful with yourself.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jos came out of his momentary reverie when he realized that Zan had spoken to him. &#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I said this one has a lacerated liver; I&#x2019;ll be done in a few more minutes.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Need any help?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Zan grinned. &#x201c;What am I, a first-year intern at Coruscant Med? No problem. Sewn one, sewn &#x2019;em all.&#x201d; He started humming again as he worked on the trooper&#x2019;s innards.<br> &nbsp;<br> Jos nodded. True enough; the Fett clones were all identical, which meant that, in addition to no rejection syndrome concerns, the surgeons didn&#x2019;t have to worry about where or how the plumbing went. Even in individuals of the same species there was often considerable diversity of physiological structure and functionality; human hearts all worked the same way, for example, but the valves could vary in size, the aortal connection might be higher in one than in another&nbsp;...&nbsp;there were a million and one ways for individual anatomies to differ. It was the biggest reason why surgery, even under the best of conditions, was never 100 percent safe.<br> &nbsp;<br> But with the clones, it was different&#x2014;or, rather, it wasn&#x2019;t. They had all been culled from the same genetic source: a human male bounty hunter named Jango Fett. All of them were even more identical than monozygotic twins. See one, do one, teach one, had been the mantra back on Coruscant, during Jos&#x2019;s training. The instructors used to joke that you could cut a clone blindfolded once you knew the layout, and that was almost true. Ordinarily Jos wouldn&#x2019;t be working on line troops, but with two of the surgical droids down for repairs, the only option was to let the injured triage up out in the mobile unit&#x2019;s hall and die. And, clones or not, he couldn&#x2019;t let that happen. He&#x2019;d become a doctor to save lives, not to judge who lived and who didn&#x2019;t.<br> &nbsp;<br> The lights abruptly blinked off, then back on. Everyone in the chamber froze momentarily.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Sweet Sookie,&#x201d; Jos said. &#x201c;Now what?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Final Shadows (A Bishop Files Novel)</h2><p><b>A desperate underground war with the survival of millions at stake looms in the electrifying conclusion of the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling Bishop Files Trilogy.</b><br><br>Tasha Solomon's world turned upside-down when the psychic abilities she had tried so hard to live with in secret suddenly made her a target stalked by unseen enemies. <br><br>John Brodie is by nature, by training, and by instinct a Guardian.

There are many reasons, not the least among them being that I myself got much more deeply involved in the situation than I had any idea of becoming when I first became aware of what was happening in the then loosely organized, almost entirely underground psychic &#x201c;community&#x201d; I was only peripherally aware of at that time.</p><p>I believed that not only could I remain on that periphery, observant and seeking to understand without interfering with what was happening, I believed it would be best for me to do so. Best for their struggle. Best for my own growing teams of psychic agents and investigators, the SCU and Haven. Best for these &#x201c;civilian&#x201d; psychics, living their desperate, secret lives alone for so long by necessity even as external events and a growing threat pushed them to reach out, to form connections between themselves and others like them in a response that was, I believe, entirely organic rather than in any way planned.</p><p>At least in the beginning.</p><p>I have come to understand that in ways I never understood before, I myself am a part of that psychic community, connected to it, linked in a way I had not believed was possible. It is something apart from the connections I feel for my teams within the SCU, a different sort of bond formed for a very, very different reason. But another organic, naturally evolving link that quite literally became necessary for the continued existence of psychics and even, perhaps, of our human species.</p><p>And the more specific links, links between myself and Miranda, between John Brodie and Tasha Solomon, between Sarah and Tucker Mackenzie, between a ten-year-old orphan child named Annabel and her unusual constant companion, and last but not by any means least the link all of us have with a remarkable woman named Murphy&#x2014;those connections and others began to assemble, finally, the puzzle of what was really happening here, and why.</p><p>Even the &#x201c;bad&#x201d; actors in all this had their parts to play, and often very highly unexpected and even positive ones. Though I have often found a clear line of demarcation between good and evil, black and white, it more often seems there are many shades of gray, many complex combinations of both good and, arguably, evil.</p><p>Evil acts do not necessarily mean that all involved are evil. And seemingly benevolent acts are not always what they seem. Lessons hard-learned.</p><p>And perhaps it is simply a universal truth that if, between the goal and the reaching of it, too many years pass, too much distance exists, too many events occur, too much &#x201c;new&#x201d; history is built and old history lost, then those once obsessive goals begin to be questioned at least by some, previously ruthless methods begin to be questioned, then that, too, is another piece of the puzzle, and a vital one.</p><p>Understanding that puzzle and what it meant had finally come, but also understanding the part each of us had to play in order to triumph. And we had to triumph. There was so very much at stake in this battle. This war. Far more than most people will ever be aware.</p><p>Few of us are able to go through our lives feeling certain of why we&#x2019;re here, of what part we&#x2019;re destined to play in our lives, let alone in our world, our history. Few of us are ever granted the certainty of knowing that our actions have true meaning, not only for ourselves but for others, even for the whole of humankind, and perhaps even its destiny.</p><p>But if any mortal can know the truth, or at least part of the truth, an unexpected and wholly remarkable part of our history and our future, a small group of very special humans knows it now. I know it now. If any mortal can look at his or her world and be certain that their own acts matter in the existence of that world, even the continuance of it, that group of people and I know it now. If any mortal can be certain of his or her place, or his or her part, in defending the very existence of our own species&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it is something of which we are utterly certain now.</p><p>The story is incredible. Some would never believe it. If I had not been a part of it, I am not sure that even I&#x2014;with so much knowledge of the capabilities of the human mind, both &#x201c;normal&#x201d; and paranormal&#x2014;would have, could have, believed it. But I was a part of it, I bore witness to what happened and why, and I am very much a believer.</p><p>I will set down as much of this knowledge and understanding as I feel I may as we agreed, here in these private reports, which may or may not be opened and read one day, depending on your decision and those who come after you. After us both.</p><p>Perhaps not would be better. But I will leave that call to you or to someone who comes after us to make. There will always, I fear, be the threat of some outside enemy determined to destroy us, and should that happen in the future, then perhaps our world will need to know that we are capable of fighting back. Even quietly, secretly, and without fanfare. Capable of fighting back, and of winning.</p><p>Despite even my own doubts as to the wisdom of revealing what lies herein my report, I only hope that one day the truth can be known.</p><p>I believe we owe that much to the warriors, to the fallen, to the silent, unnamed, unacknowledged, and largely unknown watchmen on the walls of our civilization who have guarded us, the most vulnerable among us, and even our society, without our awareness. As dangerous as the truth may prove to some, as unbelievable, as frightening, it is a truth all of humanity should know.</p><p>Respectfully submitted.</p><p>Noah Bishop, Unit Chief</p><p>Special Crimes Unit, FBI</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The darkness drops again; but now I know</p><p>That twenty centuries of stony sleep</p><p>Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,</p><p>And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,</p><p>Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?</p><p>&#x2014;W. B. Yeats</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One</p><p>Wake up.</p><p>You need to wake up.</p><p>Henry, you have to wake up.</p><p>They&#x2019;re going to kill you.</p><p>Henry McCord had a lifetime of practice in hiding the fact that he saw dead people. A medium, that&#x2019;s what it was called. He&#x2019;d been a medium for thirty-six years, more or less. He could actually remember the first time he had seen the dead and understood just what he was seeing. At his grandfather&#x2019;s funeral. The old man had stood on the other side of the casket and winked at him.</p><p>Henry had been six.</p><p>So, thirty years, really, of learning to cope in whatever way he could. Realizing early on that grown-ups didn&#x2019;t want him to talk about the dead people, that it made them really uncomfortable. Which had puzzled a childish Henry, since it seemed to him they would have liked to know that they didn&#x2019;t just go into the ground in a box and get covered with dirt, that there was something more than that. It had reassured Henry, at least then.</p><p>Now&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he didn&#x2019;t even know if he still believed that. And despite his several conversations with Bishop, he was still unconvinced that he could ever learn to control his abilities well enough to make some kind of better use of them.</p><p>He still didn&#x2019;t get how seeing dead people could be put to any real use at all, far less some larger, more important use. Not even in investigating crime, since Bishop had told him somewhat ruefully that the dead, especially the murdered dead, seldom showed up to help in any way at all, far less to tell those investigating the crime who had killed them.</p><p>So what was the use in that?</p><p>What made that a larger, more important use of his abilities?</p><p>Having some sort of control over what he could do had appealed to him, if only when he&#x2019;d thought he might be able to control it. He had tried. When he was alone. When he could try without fearing somebody would come along with a giant butterfly net and scoop him up and take him away to a mental hospital where his &#x201c;gift&#x201d; would be medicated away&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>They took you. Not doctors. The others.</p><p>Others. The others. The others?</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>Henry had thought he was asleep and dreaming, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it didn&#x2019;t feel like it was a dream, that voice in his head. It didn&#x2019;t feel like his soft bed beneath him. It felt like something cold and hard, something not a mattress. Something that was maybe metal.</p><p>And&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he was almost sure he couldn&#x2019;t move. Almost sure his wrists were tied down. His ankles. Something tight around his head holding it still.</p><p>They&#x2019;ve got you, Henry.</p><p>Who&#x2019;s got me? He wanted to ask it out loud, but something told him he should remain silent. And he wasn&#x2019;t sure he could have said anything out loud anyway. His mouth felt like it was full of cotton and his entire face felt like he&#x2019;d been shot up with Novocaine.</p><p>Them.</p><p>It meant nothing to him, and yet&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and yet it did. It frightened him on a level so deep it was primal. It meant coldness and darkness and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and shadows. It meant shadows moving all around him, implacable and remorseless, bent on doing&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. whatever it was they meant to do to him. It meant something cold and slimy that had slithered into his life, into his mind.</p><p>Maybe into his soul.</p><p>Not spirits? Not the dead? He asked not knowing if there would be someone, anyone, to answer him. Not knowing if the voice inside his head might not be his own.</p><p>No, Henry. The dead aren&#x2019;t curious to know how you&#x2019;re able to see them. The dead don&#x2019;t want to turn you inside out to learn what makes your ability work.</p><p>Henry felt an even deeper, icy jolt of terror.</p><p>Unlike what he&#x2019;d seen in various movies and TV shows about ghosts and hauntings, Henry had never had to face a negative experience because of his ability. No angry or malevolent spirits, no spirits that looked disfigured or deformed or even showed the causes of their deaths. None who had made any attempt at all to frighten him.</p><p>Just helpful spirits dressed in period costume who led the way through basements and attics and storage buildings to things that belonged in whatever building he was restoring. That was all.</p><p>Henry had never been afraid of them.</p><p>He was afraid now.</p><p>They&#x2019;ll use your fear. You have to&#x2014;</p><p>Who are you?</p><p>Henry&#x2014;</p><p>Who are you? How do I know you&#x2019;re even on my side?</p><p>What is your side, Henry?</p><p>It&#x2019;s&#x2014; I want to live. I want to go back to that house I was restoring near Charleston. I want to go back to my life.</p><p>Then you need to listen to me.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Because I survived what you&#x2019;re about to go through. Because I didn&#x2019;t let them break me. And you can&#x2019;t let them break you.</p><p>But&#x2014;</p><p>Listen to me. You have to answer them when they ask you questions. You have to be helpful. Because if they can&#x2019;t get any answers from asking, then they&#x2019;ll start cutting. And burning. And&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. putting things inside you.</p><p>Things?</p><p>Things to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. examine you. Things to help them get answers. So you have to answer them. You have to try as hard as you can to keep them talking.</p><p>But I don&#x2019;t know much. About how it works, what I can do.</p><p>Don&#x2019;t tell them that, Henry. Not until you have no other choice. Because when you tell them that, they&#x2019;ll want to find out if you&#x2019;re lying. They&#x2019;ll hurt you. They&#x2019;ll try to break you.</p><p>How?</p><p>Just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. don&#x2019;t let them do that. Do you hear me, Henry? Cooperate. Answer their questions. Don&#x2019;t make them hurt you.</p><p>Who are you? he demanded insistently.</p><p>A friend. Please, Henry, just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. hang on.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Juno Hicks leaned against the hard wall, trying not to pant out loud because she&#x2019;d been tired to begin with and the effort had been so great. To reach through walls, over an unknown distance, and touch another mind, a mind not hardwired as hers was to communicate like this.</p><p>Not another telepath.</p><p>Still leaning back against the wall, she looked around at the tiny cell that had become her world. Eight feet by twelve feet.</p><p>She had paced it off.</p><p>That was her world, and had been for God only knew how long. A narrow cot. The kind of stainless steel toilet-with-sink arrangement found in prison cells, right out in the open with no privacy. One chair, bolted to the floor.</p><p>One chair.</p><p>She had never sat in it, avoided it instinctively for some reason she didn&#x2019;t question. And none of them had ever sat in it. None of them ever came into this room, except to drag her out of it.</p><p>She knew they watched her, even though there was no observation window or port or camera she could see. But they watched her.</p><p>She knew they watched.</p><p>And maybe she&#x2019;d taken a chance reaching out to Henry, talking to him, when all she&#x2019;d intended was yet another desperate telepathic exploration of whatever lay beyond these walls, beyond the short hallway and the other&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The Room&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that was all she knew of this place, all they&#x2019;d allowed her to see, at least with her eyes.</p><p>So she reached out, hoping to sense something that might help her. If she got the chance. If she could run. Silent, hoping none of the psychics who had sold their souls to them were nearby, or if they were that they were unable to detect her efforts.</p><p>She was very careful.</p><p>But today she had touched Henry&#x2019;s mind. And recognized him as another prisoner, another&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. subject. New, frightened, bewildered. In no shape to answer the questions she had wanted so desperately to ask him.</p><p>Do they know about us?</p><p>Will anyone come for us?</p><p>Does anyone care what&#x2019;s happening to us?</p><p>No, Henry could not have answered those questions, not today. Maybe&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. maybe later. She hoped. She hoped so bad. For some kind of news.</p><p>For some kind of hope.</p><p>But for now he was another victim. Someone she had to try to help, to try to warn. So maybe he would know just enough to escape their punishments.</p><p>She held up one hand and stared at it, at the bandage that made her hand a fist because it covered the stumps of what had been her fingers.</p><p>&#x201c;Hold on, Henry,&#x201d; she whispered. &#x201c;Hold on as long as you can.&#x201d;</p><p>* * *</p><p>&#x201c;Report.&#x201d;</p><p>Sebring stood before the group of her superiors, more relaxed than many might have been because she was a highly capable and confident woman.</p><p>Some would have said arrogant. Had said, in fact.</p><p>Brisk and impersonal, she said, &#x201c;There have been increasing signs that the resistance movement is gaining strength. Their numbers grow almost daily, and it&#x2019;s clear they have hidden assets providing them with important resources.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What kind of resources?&#x201d; the man at the head of the table asked.</p><p>&#x201c;High-tech equipment and access to information, contacts within various branches of law enforcement and the government, fast travel when needed, possibly weapons.

The author&#x2019;s accessible writing style, the wealth of examples, and the numerous exercises provide opportunities for practicing and refining the skills of becoming a qualitative researcher. The new edition focuses on the development of research proposals (Ch. 2); the history and concerns of institutional review boards (IRBs) and issues qualitative researchers sometimes confront when submitting proposals (Ch. 6); greater information and examples on coding and thematic analysis, while also introducing other approaches to data analysis (Ch. 7); and arts based research through a chapter that encourages consideration of creative ways to approach and represent inquiry (Ch. 9).

What if this is merely a self-portrait shaped by false identification, habit, and assumptions?</p><p> In ever-growing gatherings worldwide, the revered teacher Mooji has opened the eyes of thousands through his rare ability to shine light on the ineffable with uncommon clarity, humor, and warmth. Now, with <i>Vaster Than Sky, Greater Than Space</i>, Mooji invites and inspires readers everywhere to discover the true essence from which we all arise.</p><p> The Advaita Vedanta tradition teaches that through simple questioning and introspection, we can awaken to something far greater than the ego self, a nondual Oneness with the ground of Being.

Like other European cities, it was still emerging from its medieval past. But in a mere century Paris would be transformed into the modern and mythic city we know today.</p><p>Though most people associate the signature characteristics of Paris with the public works of the nineteenth century, Joan DeJean demonstrates that the Parisian model for urban space was in fact invented two centuries earlier, when the first complete design for the French capital was drawn up and implemented. As a result, Paris saw many changes. It became the first city to tear down its fortifications, inviting people in rather than keeping them out. Parisian urban planning showcased new kinds of streets, including the original boulevard, as well as public parks and the earliest sidewalks and bridges without houses. Venues opened for urban entertainment of all kinds, from opera and ballet to a pastime invented in Paris, recreational shopping. Parisians enjoyed the earliest public transportation and street lighting, and Paris became Europe's first great walking city. </p><p>A century of planned development made Paris both beautiful and exciting. It gave people reasons to be out in public as never before and as nowhere else. And it gave Paris its modern identity as a place that people dreamed of seeing. By 1700, Paris had become the capital that would revolutionize our conception of the city and of urban life.</p></p><p><b>Joan DeJean</b> is Trustee Professor at the University of Pennsylvania.

He is a surrealist, in the tradition of the great Spanish director Luis Bunuel. Over the course of a career that includes such films as <b>The Elephant Man</b>, <b>Blue Velvet</b>, <b>Wild at Heart</b>, <b>Lost Highway</b>, and the seminal TV series <b>Twin Peaks</b>, Lynch has remained true to an artistic vision of innocence lost or adrift in the direst states of darkness and confusion. Nobody else sees the world quite as David Lynch does. Once seen, his films are never forgotten, nor does the world about us seem quite as it did before.<br><br>In this definitive career-length interview book, Lynch speaks openly about the full breadth of his creative work, which encompasses not only movies but also a lifelong commitment to painting, a continuing exploration of photography, extensive work in television, and musical collaborations with composer Angelo Badalamenti and singer Julee Cruise.</p><p>You know David Lynch as the director of terminally weird movies such as <i>Eraserhead</i>, <i>Blue Velvet</i>, and <i>Wild at Heart</i>, as well as the bizarre and highly influential television series <i>Twin Peaks</i>. But did you know that it was Mel Brooks who gave him his first big break? That the idea for <i>Blue Velvet</i> grew out of a fantasy Lynch had about sneaking into a private room and learning the secret to a murder mystery? That <i>Twin Peaks</i> came about because co-creator Mark Frost was obsessed with Marilyn Monroe? <p> In <i>Lynch on Lynch</i>, a 250-page interview book, editor Chris Rodley does a superb job of getting Lynch to talk at length about the high and low points of his life and career. Their conversation covers his early work as a painter through the making of his major films of the 1980s, the fiasco of <i>Dune</i> ("It is what it is."), and the recent and very obscure <i>Lost Highway</i> ("I just *loved* this title."). </p><p> Lynch is particularly interesting when he talks about the creative process: "I don't want to give the impression that I sit around thinking up horrible things. I get all kinds of different ideas and feelings. If I'm lucky, they start organizing themselves into a story--then maybe some ideas come along that are too eerie, too violent, or too funny, and they don't fit that story. So you write them down and save them for two or three projects down the road. There's nowhere you can't go in a film--if you think of it, you can go there." <i>Lynch on Lynch</i> is a treat for Lynch fans of all shapes, sizes, and fetishes.</p>David Keith Lynch (born January 20, 1946) is an American filmmaker, painter, musician, actor, and photographer. He has been described by The Guardian as "the most important director of this era",[1] while AllMovie called him "the Renaissance man of modern American filmmaking".[2] His films Blue Velvet (1986) and Mulholland Drive (2001) are widely considered by critics to be among the greatest films of their respective decades,[3][4] while the success of his 1990&#x2013;91 television series Twin Peaks led to his being labeled "the first popular Surrealist" by film critic Pauline Kael.[5] He has received three Academy Award nominations[6] for Best Director, and has won France's C�sar Award for Best Foreign Film twice, as well as the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival[7] and a Golden Lion award for lifetime achievement at the Venice Film Festival.</p><h2>The Magic Pattern Book: Sew 6 Patterns into 36 Different Styles!</h2><p><p><b>A whole wardrobe in a book.</b><br><br> Imagine a pattern.

She works in black ink, devoting meticulous attention to each object, drawing hedgehog quills and jellyfish tendrils with something like scientific precision.

An apple core below attracts ants, and in another bonus the&nbsp;<i>A</i>&nbsp;is argyle.&nbsp;<i>B</i>&nbsp;has a butterfly, a branch, and a braid of dark hair tied with a blue bow.

(Jan.)</i> <br><i><br>KIRKUS REVIEW <br>A wordless alphabet book becomes an identification game.<br>It&#x2019;s the ink-and-watercolor illustrations that set this apart from others of its ilk, with striking page compositions that will engage readers. Each capital letter dominates the page, most in double-page spreads and often decorated, with white backgrounds that dramatize the objects it stands for. At first glance there seems to be only one or two items per letter. On a closer look, other items appear. On top of the letter A, for instance, are two arrows piercing a whole apple, while at the bottom, scads of ants attack an eaten apple core. Kids will easily name the apple, ants, and arrows but are likely to miss the argyle plaid that fills in the letter. Other letters are also textured with fabrics or wood. There aren&#x2019;t many surprises for the &#x201c;difficult&#x201d; letters: Q is for Quail, Quarters, Queen, and Quilt pattern; U is for Unicorn (depicted Upside-down); X is for X-ray; Y is for Yarn; and Z is for Zigzag, Zinnia, and Zebra. Even when the items depicted are fairly unimaginative, though, the execution is superb, and the Goose sitting in Grass watching Grasshoppers gambol on the G makes up for a lot. A two-page key at the back identifies each of the items.<br>On the whole, sophisticated, subtle, and stunning.&nbsp;<i>(Alphabet book. 5-8)</i> <br></i></p><h2>Kitchen Princess Omnibus 2</h2><p>THE PRINCE REVEALED?<br>&nbsp;<br>Najika came to Seika Academy to find the boy who saved her life.

Metal groaned as the bow of our ship split down the middle and the two twenty-ton doors swung open to the black sea. Behind the doors, amtracs were lined up inside the belly of the ship like green, steel beetles. <br>On deck, the sound of the ship waking up got our minds focused on the assault ahead of us. We were going to be in the .rst waves of men to hit the beach. It all made sense, if you were a war planner who calculated schedules, machines, casualties and such. But we were the ones they made their plans on, so no matter how much sense it made on paper, you&#x2019;re never quite ready to be in that .rst group&#x2014; even Marines like the boys in my platoon. They were mostly teenagers, a few were in their early twenties, and inexperienced, except for a few vets like me who rode herd. They were gung-ho and itching to get into the .ght but even so, I could read their faces, being the .rst to face enemy .re was making them think things over. My younger brother George, a vet of Saipan and Tinian, saw these kids back in Hawaii and asked me, &#x201c;Where the hell are the vets? You&#x2019;re gonna get yourself killed. Y&#x2019;oughta come over to the 4th with me.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Nothing doin&#x2019;,&#x201d; I told him. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m stayin&#x2019; put.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Stubborn fuck, always were.&#x201d; George spit on the deck. Seemed like he didn&#x2019;t give a shit about anything anymore. I guessed it was from Saipan&#x2014; where they say things got pretty rough. Over three thousand men, including most of his friends, got killed. <br>We were the 5th Division. Like George said, we had a lot of the younger legs in our out.t. Those young legs would get us across the beach faster to the air.eld, our .rst objective. But we both knew that these youngsters would take the brunt of the dying. When you know how war works, like a wolf pack on the hunt, it made sense. But it still wasn&#x2019;t right. These boys were the bravest we had. They didn&#x2019;t wait to get drafted, they joined the Marines, and that should count for something. But of course, in the logic of war, it didn&#x2019;t. <br>The boys .nished their prayers and the chaplain blessed us. The swabbies powered up more diesels and set to work getting the landing craft&#x2014;medium (LCMs) and landing craft&#x2014;personnel (LCPs) that would bring in the supplies after we hit the beach, hoisted up on the davits and swung over the side. All the activity set the boys murmuring to each other, &#x201c;Here we go,&#x201d; and &#x201c;This is it.&#x201d; For a second some of them looked down, bit their lips, like kids anywhere who were about to be punished. Inside I know some were panicking, feeling their nerve fail, even after all the training and preparation. Their instinct for survival was taking over. They wanted to beg for their lives, or hide in some cubbyhole or ammo crate of our huge transport ship, but they didn&#x2019;t do it. They sucked it up and believed they were ready. They weren&#x2019;t. What can I tell you about these young guys standing out on the cold deck with me? I loved them as much as my own brothers. Some were skinheaded young boots when they came into my platoon, some were fresh out of paratrooper school and were pissed off to be humping metal through the mud instead of .oating down from the air under green silk. But all that was over now. The last six months of training together every day made them as tough and tight-knit a . ghting platoon as I ever knew. They were the kind of heroes I wanted to be, not the Medal of Honor showboat that Topside wanted me to be. <br>Then a strange thing happened. As I watched them, I felt something release, all of a sudden. I can&#x2019;t really explain it, but it felt like a knot in my chest, that was there all my life, suddenly came loose. I was free somehow and quiet inside. The voice that had been inside my head since I can remember, the one that whispers all the time and gets loud when you do something wrong, was suddenly gone. When that voice in your head suddenly stops, you notice. At least I did, because I had learned to listen to it. It sounds strange and I don&#x2019;t go in for any sort of mumbo jumbo as a rule, but the voice told me the future, and did it more than once. Three different times I heard it clear as a bell, and it was right all three times. So I guess I learned to listen a little closer than most people. The voice was de.nitely gone. Maybe I just didn&#x2019;t need it anymore. <br>It was half-light, just as the sun was crowning over the horizon behind storm clouds. It was February 19th, 1945, Monday, the beginning of the workweek. We were scheduled to hit the beach at 0900. Christ almighty, Monday at 9 A.M. just like we were starting a new job, punching a time clock. It made you wonder if God didn&#x2019;t have some kind of dark sense of humor. The heavy seas of last night had calmed down to gentle swells. I was standing there on deck and must have looked like a tourist with nothing to do. I looked up. Storm clouds covered us like dirty wool. They changed their mind every ten minutes whether to rain or not. At the horizon, the clouds broke up. Behind them was a red-orange sky and I remembered, &#x201c;... Red sky at morning, sailors take warning,&#x201d; but it was too late for warnings now. <br>Then the boys heard the amtrac engines .ring up belowdecks and they looked at me like, &#x201c;What do we do now, Sarge?&#x201d; Fear was already beginning to numb them. It was a natural reaction. They were like deer sensing the hungry wolves were already too close. They knew it was too late to run so they froze, hoping the wolves would miss them. And there they stood, my platoon of .fty-eight young warriors, still as sticks, looking at me. I told them to get down the gangways and get going. <br>I knew what was about to happen to them. They didn&#x2019;t know and so they were afraid. But I knew. &#x201c;All Marines prepare to disembark!&#x201d; The loudspeaker backed me up. The boys gathered up their things, all in a rush, like they were going to miss something. They weren&#x2019;t going to miss anything. They packed up the heavy 30-cal Brownies, the air-cooled 30s, the mortars, the razor-stropped K-Bar knives and bayonets. They wouldn&#x2019;t need any of these things right now. They would just need their young legs to carry them as far and as fast as they could, across the beach, straight into a nightmare they would never wake up from. The guns and the knives would come later, for those of us who were left to . ght back. <br>They would need me even more, very soon. They would think that hell had opened up a back door just for them. They wouldn&#x2019;t know which way to go. Some wouldn&#x2019;t be able to move and would be surprised that their legs didn&#x2019;t obey. You couldn&#x2019;t tell which ones by looking at them. The bravest ones in camp sometimes buried their faces in the sand and wet their pants. You just couldn&#x2019;t tell and neither could they. That&#x2019;s when they&#x2019;ll need me. They&#x2019;ll need me to pull them or kick them to get off the beach. Maybe that&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m calm, because I know I&#x2019;ll save some of them. <br>We .led down the gangways into the ship&#x2019;s steel belly. Half of my boys loaded into amphibious tractor 3C27 with me. Amtrac 3C27 was an armor-plated, rectangular tub made for delivering men onto a beach. It rode low and slow in the water. The best of them couldn&#x2019;t take much more than a two-foot ocean swell. What we found out was that if they didn&#x2019;t sink in the water, they sank in the loose, volcanic sand. It seemed like war plans never went according to plan. <br>We climbed into the hold of this steel tank. The engines thundered inside the metal walls of the ship. We rolled down the ramp and plopped into the open ocean. The driver gunned the engine and we churned away toward the island just over a mile in front of us. <br>The fellas were hunkered down in the hold and some were starting to look as green as the olive-drab metal around us. There was already an inch of water on the deck. Some of the boys were worried about that. We all heard the joke about these things capsizing if two men farted in the same direction. Then the big Navy guns opened up. They threw the big 16-inch shells that weighed as much as a Jeep. They threw them a few miles and we could see them hit the side of Mount Suribachi on shore with a little red .ash and gray blossoms of debris thrown up. The force of the cannon .re pushed six-foot waves out from the battleships. These concussion waves rode up under our keel, tossing us up higher and .ipping our steak and eggs breakfast over in our bellies. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s gonna be alright, boys. They&#x2019;re gonna be dizzy as shithouse rats after we get done pounding &#x2019;em,&#x201d; I lied&#x2014; just like Topside lied to us when they told us it would be over in seventy-two hours. All of us vets knew that seventy-two hours was pure bullshit and said so. It was like an involuntary reaction. The minute it dropped from the CO&#x2019;s mouth, it sounded like a dozen men coughed at once. But it was a dozen mumbled bullshits jumping right off the lips of us vets. We couldn&#x2019;t help it. There were twenty-two thousand Japanese jungle .ghters straight ahead who had been digging in and calibrating their guns for the past three months. That meant they had coordinates for every square inch of beach and could put Japanese steel on any point almost instantly. Maybe they thought we were all young boots who hadn&#x2019;t seen action yet. <br>We also expected mines and railroad ties raked at a 45-degree angle in the shallow surf that could punch through the bottom of our amtrac like a tin can. Before we got in the boats we smeared white .ash cream on our faces, a thick grease that smelled like a garage .oor. This was to protect us from the drums of gasoline that might explode under our tracks as we got close to the beach. <br>We didn&#x2019;t know it at the time, but the Japs also had new weapons: an array of huge mortars and an early version of a buzz bomb&#x2014;a r...</p></p><h2>The Cognitive Behavioral Workbook for Weight Management: A Step-by-Step Program (A New Harbinger Self-Help Workbook)</h2><p><p>We all think we know what we have to do to manage our weight, and blame ourselves when we don't meet the goals we have set.

Even now, some seventy years after its inception, some consider its foundation uncertain and its structure weak. At this moment of incipient strategic crisis, Timothy A. Sayle offers a sweeping history of the most critical alliance in the post-World War II era. </p><p>In <i>Enduring Alliance</i>, Sayle recounts how the western European powers, along with the United States and Canada, developed a treaty to prevent encroachments by the Soviet Union and to serve as a first defense in any future military conflict. As the growing and unruly hodgepodge of countries, councils, commands, and committees inflated NATO during the Cold War, Sayle shows that the work of executive leaders, high-level diplomats, and institutional functionaries within NATO kept the alliance alive and strong in the face of changing administrations, various crises, and the flux of geopolitical maneuverings. Resilience and flexibility have been the true hallmarks of NATO.</p><p>As <i>Enduring Alliance </i>deftly shows, the history of NATO is organized around the balance of power, preponderant military forces, and plans for nuclear war. But it is also the history riven by generational change, the introduction of new approaches to conceiving international affairs, and the difficulty of diplomacy for democracies. As NATO celebrates its seventieth anniversary, the alliance once again faces challenges to its very existence even as it maintains its place firmly at the center of western hemisphere and global affairs.</p></p><p><p>Timothy A. Sayle is Assistant Professor of History at the University of Toronto and a fellow of the Bill Graham Centre for Contemporary International History and the Southern Methodist University's Center for Presidential History.</p><p>"At a time when the president of the US is questioning the future of NATO, it is essential to understand the alliance's past. Timothy Andrews Sayle's engaging account shows why NATO came into being, how it has endured, and where it may be going. Highly recommended."</p> (Mary Sarotte, author of <i>1989</i>)<br><br><p>"The logic, history, and analysis of&nbsp;<i>Enduring Alliance</i>&nbsp;are impeccable, and Timothy Andrews Sayle's account is particularly useful at this moment when the Atlantic partnership is on unsteady ground. A must-read for policymakers seeking to ensure the Pax Atlantic is the indispensable and truly enduring alliance of our times."</p> (Admiral James Stavridis, USN (Ret), Supreme Allied Commander at NATO, 2009-2013, and author of&nbsp;<i>The Accidental Admiral</i>)<br><br><p>"Timothy A. Sayle's <i>Enduring Alliance</i> abounds with keen insights and brilliant turns of phrase. <i>Enduring Alliance</i> excavates a vital history that speaks to our present moment and will be a valuable resource for scholars, students, and interested readers and policymakers."</p> (Christopher McKnight Nichols, Oregon State University, and author of&nbsp;<i>Promise and Peril</i>)<br><br><p>"<i>Enduring Alliance</i> is an ambitious, wide-ranging, and much-needed book in the development of inter-alliance politics within NATO."</p> (Matthew Jones, London School of Economics, and author of <i>After Hiroshima</i>)<br><br><p>"<i>Enduring Alliance</i> is a deeply researched and engaging account of the complicated and consequential history of the United States and NATO. Sayle offers new insights, exposes various myths, and explores the complexities and challenges of this unique, oft-troubled, but resilient alliance. Must-read for scholars of history, security studies, and institutions, as well as anyone concerned about the state of NATO today."</p> (Francis J.

(1.8-2.7 m)<br>Description: Distinguished by its large size, prominent shoulder hump and huge feet with prominent claws.<br>Habitat: Open habitats and forested areas throughout most of the state excluding the southeasternmost islands.<br>Comments: Three subspecies of brown bear are found in Alaska. One group lives in coastal areas and feeds primarily on salmon. A second group (often called 'grizzlies') are found in inland and northern habitats; these are typically smaller since they have less protein in their diet. A third group found on Kodiak Osland are classified as a separate subspecies since they are physically isolated. The huge Kodiak Island brown bears are considered the largest land carnivores in the world. Though the polar bear (U. maritimus) is larger still, it is considered a marine mammal.<br></p><h2>Rock the Shack: Architecture of Cabins, Cocoons and Hide-outs: The Architecture of Cabins, Cocoons and Hide-Outs</h2><p>Rock the Shack takes us to the places we long for. For the first time in the history of humankind, more people live in cities than in the country. Yet, at the same time, more and more city dwellers are yearning for rural farms, mountain cabins, or seaside homes. These kinds of refuges offer modern men and women a promise of what urban centers usually cannot provide: quiet, relaxation, being out of reach, getting back to basics, feeling human again. Rock the Shack is a survey of such contemporary refuges from around the world from basic to luxury. The book features a compelling range of sparingly to intricately furnished cabins, cottages, second homes, tree houses, transformations, shelters, and cocoons. The look of the included structures from the outside is just as important as the view from inside. What these diverse projects have in common is an exceptional spirit that melds the uniqueness of a geographic location with the individual character of the building s owner and architect.</p><p></p><h2>Reinforcements: How to Get People to Help You</h2><p><p>Imagine walking up to a stranger on the subway and asking them for their seat. What about asking a random person on the street if you could borrow their phone? If the idea makes you squeamish, you're not alone--social psychologists have found that doing these very things makes most of us almost unbearably uncomfortable.</p><p>But here's the funny thing: even though we hate to ask for help, <i>most people are wired to be helpful</i>. And that's a good thing, because every day in the modern, uber-collaborative workplace, we all need to know when and how to call in the cavalry.</p><p>However, asking people for help isn't intuitive; in fact, a lot of our instincts are wrong. As a result, we do a poor job of calling in the reinforcements we need, leaving confused or even offended colleagues in our wake.</p><p>This pragmatic book explains how to get it right. With humor, insight, and engaging storytelling, Heidi Grant, PhD, describes how to elicit helpful behavior from your friends, family, and colleagues--in a way that leaves them feeling genuinely happy to lend a hand.</p><p>Whether you're a first-time manager or a seasoned leader, getting people to pitch in is what leadership <i>is</i>. Fortunately, people have a natural instinct to help other human beings; you just need to know how to channel this urge into what it is you specifically need them to do. It's not manipulation. It's just management.</p></p><p><p><b>Heidi Grant, PhD</b>, is a social psychologist who researches, writes, and speaks about the science of motivation.

Global climate change, shifting global cycles of the weather, widespread pollution, radioactive fallout, plastic accumulation, species invasions, the mass extinction of species - these are just some of the many indicators that we will leave a lasting record in rock, the scientific basis for recognizing new time intervals in Earth's history. The "Anthropocene," as the proposed new epoch has been named, is regularly in the news. <br><br>Even with such robust evidence, the proposal to formally recognize our current time as the Anthropocene remains controversial both inside and outside the scholarly world, kindling intense debates. The reason is clear. The Anthropocene represents far more than just another interval of geologic time. Instead, the Anthropocene has emerged as a powerful new narrative, a concept through which age-old questions about the meaning of nature and even the nature of humanity are being revisited and radically revised. <br><br>This <em>Very Short Introduction</em> explains the science behind the Anthropocene and the many proposals about when to mark its beginning: The nuclear tests of the 1950s? The beginnings of agriculture? The origins of humans as a species? Erle Ellis considers the many ways that the Anthropocene's "evolving paradigm" is reshaping the sciences, stimulating the humanities, and foregrounding the politics of life on a planet transformed by humans.
